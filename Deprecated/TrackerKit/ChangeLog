    * Source/GNUmakefile: Added ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS to have headers properly
    available and removed Query.[hm] and Tracker.[hm] from it (residual
    references to TKStructuralKey may prevent compilation). Fixes submitted
    by Placid Pundit.
    Removed verbose license notice not really needed.
