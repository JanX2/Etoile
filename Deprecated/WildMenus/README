WildMenus, by Michael Hanni (mhanni@yahoo.com)
==============================================

Based off Nicolas Roard's excellent Camaelon:

make

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSAppKitUserBundles '( "WildMenusLocation/WildMenus.themeEngine" )'

(with WildMenusLocation the path to WildMenus.themeEngine).

Now, just try to run a GNUstep program ... :-)

Camaelon and WildMenus
======================

In case you are using both WildMenus and Camaelon, you need to do:

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSAppKitUserBundles '( "WildMenusLocation/WildMenus.themeEngine", "CamaelonLocation/Camaelon.themeEngine" )'

Tips:

(20:14:29) MrBIOS-GS: mykull: you should make an addition to that README 
that says you need to blow away your menu location defaults
(20:14:38) MrBIOS-GS: eg 'defaults delete GWorkspace NSMenuLocations'
