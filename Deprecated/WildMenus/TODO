//1.) _reorganizeMenu should compare selectors not titles (for localized 
//apps) (does this work now?)
2.) setApplicationMenu: / applicationMenu in NSApplication?
//3.) submenus of the main menu should be atleast the same size as the 
//    item that calls them
3b.) is that enough, or should I add another pixel or two?
//4.) copy app-icon and use the copy
//5.) spacing of appicon and app title fixups.
5b.) So what if the icon has a lot of empty space in it? a 'la GNUMail?
//6.) center menu text vertically
7.) if a submenu has no children, i.e. items, should it be disabled? in 
update
8.) fix GORM buglets.
