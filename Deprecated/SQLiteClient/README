It uses sqlite3 and build as a single library.
Therefore, it will not load other database bundles.
It is intended to be used within Etoile project on Mac OS X.
For GNUstep, please use SQLClient/SQLite instead.

SQLClient and GNUstep uses LGPL2. SQLiteClient uses BSD license whenever it is 
applicable. (see COPYING document)
