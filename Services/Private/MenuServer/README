EtoileMenuServer
================

The server app which provides the menubar's
background. Compile, no need to install, just "openapp" it. The clock
menulet is included.

EtoileMenuServer communicates with System the Etoile daemonizer to handle 
requests such as sleep, reboot and shut down. System plays the role of a session 
manager in Etoile environment. You can specifiy another session manager than 
System by setting assigning another name to ETSessionManager default and 
registering an object in some other process for this name by the mean of 
Distributed Objects. Then EtoileMenuServer will retrieve a proxy for this object 
and forward those requests to it. This remote object must implement a simple 
protocol that consists of the following messages:

- (oneway void) logOut;
- (oneway void) powerOff: (BOOL)reboot;
- (oneway void) suspend;

System implements theses messages in SCSystem class.
