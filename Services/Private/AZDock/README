AZDock is a dock for Etoile
It depends on XWindowServerKit 
and requires Azalea for tracking xwindow windows.

Behaviors
---------
Left-click on dock to raise windows on current desktop.
If there is no windows on current desktop, 
it will automatically change desktop to the one having windows.
COMMAND+Left-click will create new window for xwindow application,
but not GNUstep application.

In short, left-click to switch application and workspace if necessary.
COMMAND+left-click to create new application for xwindows.

An alternate "autoorganize" behavior can be enabled by compiling with the flag 
 -DAUTOORGANIZE

User Defaults
-------------
Key: DockPosition
Value: 0 (Left side), 1 (Right side), 2 (Bottom side)
Key: AutoHidden
Value: YES or NO;

NOTE
----
If you have GWorkspace installed, GNUstep will try to use it automatically.
Therefore, whenever you start AZDock, GWorkspace will also start.
If you don't want this to happen, use
`defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSWorkspaceApplication NotExist.app` block it.

TODO
----
* Drag file on icon and call -application:openFile: ?
* Open new window if there is no one on current desktop.
  (Or should we switch back to the existing one ? )
* List all windows and documents on contextual menu.
* Use freedesktop spec to get icon of xwindow applications
  instead of caching our own.
* Drag-and-drop to organize icon
* Support docking regular file ? Or leave it to shelf ?.
* Figure out how to change icon according to app icon from GNUstep application.
  See AZGNUstepApp -acceptXWindow: for all options.
* Autoorganize behavior should be controlled by a default and improved to be 
  more usable (like handling xterms in a nicer way)
* Should be possible to switch between standard and autoorganize behaviors at 
  runtime (by selecting an option in the flower menu of the dock for example, 
  even if in the end the behavior choice should probably be made available 
  only through a default for power users)

DESIGN
------
AZDock deal with many types of applications. Each one need special case.

* XWindow:
  AZDock listens to Azalea about the launch and termination fo XWindows.
  XWindow is window-based. It keeps all windows from the same program
  under a dock. 

* GNUstep: 
  AZDock use NSWorkspace to track GNUstep applications, 
  with notification from Azalea for abnormal termination. 
 
* WindowMaker Docklet:
  AZDock listens to Azalea for docklet. Docklet starts as unmapped xwindow. 
  Therefore, it is not treated as regular X window.
  It need to be launched automatically.
  Although docklet is older than other similar implementation,
  it is used to expriment reparenting X window onto NSWindow.

* System Trays:
  In FreeDesktop.org specification, system trays is where program can stay
  and send notification. Actually, it is very similar to GNUstep's app icon.
  Because XWindow is window-based, once window is closed, program terminates.
  Some programs need to stay running when their windows close, for example,
  instant messenger. Therefore, system tray is where it can stay.
