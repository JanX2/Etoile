AZDock is a dock for Etoile
It depends on XWindowServerKit 
and requires Azalea for tracking xwindow windows.

User Defaults
-------------
Key: DockPosition
Value: 0 (Left side), 1 (Right side), 2 (Bottom side)

NOTE
----
If you have GWorkspace installed, GNUstep will try to use it automatically.
Therefore, whenever you start AZDock, GWorkspace will also start.
If you don't want this to happen, use
`defaults write NSGlobalDomain GSWorkspaceApplication NotExist.app` block it.

TODO
----
* Drag file on icon and call -application:openFile: ?
* Open new window if there is no one on current desktop.
  (Or should we switch back to the existing one ? )
* List all windows and documents on contextual menu.
* Use freedesktop spec to get icon of xwindow applications
  instead of caching our own.
* Drag-and-drop to organize icon
* Support docking regular file ? Or leave it to shelf ?.
* Figure out how to change icon according to app icon from GNUstep application.
  See AZGNUstepApp -acceptXWindow: for all options.
