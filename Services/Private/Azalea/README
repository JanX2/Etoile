Azalea

:License:  GPL 2.0 by following OpenBox3

Azalea is a GNUstep window mamager, 
based on OpenBox3 (http://icculus.org/openbox/).

INSTALL
-------

Azalea is based on the configuration of my system.
It may not work on others.
If so, modify GNUmakefile for dependencies (libxml, freetype, fontconfig).
Custom resource files (rc.xml and menu.xml) should be under 
$HOME/.config/openbox/.
(See OpenBox3 website for more details).  
It may help by installing openbox3 first to get all the resources,
especially themes and xml-related files.

Azalea works fine with ObConf (http://tr.openmonkey.com/pages/obconf).
