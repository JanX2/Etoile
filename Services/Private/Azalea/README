*** Azalea ***

Azalea is a GNUstep window mamager, 
based on OpenBox3 (http://icculus.org/openbox/).

Azalea is released under GPL 2.0 by following OpenBox3.

*** INSTALL ***
Azalea is based on the configuration of my system.
It may not work on others.
If so, modify GNUmakefile for dependencies (glib, libxml, freetype, fontconfig).
Resource files (rc.xml and menu.xml) should be under $HOME/.config/openbox/.
(See OpenBox3 website for more details).  
It may help by install openbox3 first to get all the resources,
especially themes and xml-related files.

Azalea works fine with ObConf (http://tr.openmonkey.com/pages/obconf).
