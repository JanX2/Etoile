2009-04-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.m (-init, -setUpTerminateLater:):
	* EtoileSystem.m (-findConfigFileAndStartUpdateMonitoring):
	* SCTask.m (-launchForDomain:):
	Improved formatting a bit by declaring invocation and timer variables 
	where they are initialized rather than at the start of the method.
	Kept a single FIXME about NS_MESSAGE being broken.
	Also fixed C header include statements to use #include and not #import, 
	and put framework import statements at top.

2008-11-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Made the code a bit more solid and simpler. Now handles the launch queue 
	without gdnc. Also added a time limit for a launch to finish. These two 
	changes ensures the launch sequence won't be stalled when distributed 
	notification are not working well, as reported on etoile-dev with recent 
	GNUstep trunk.
	To depend on distributed notifications to start processes just add more 
	complexity and is undesirable as such.
	System is still unable to track launched applications and thereby to close 
	the session properly. The GNUstep issue that is behind it and also motivated 
	the committed changes is described here: http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?24939
	* SCTask.m:
	(-launchTimeOut, -checkLaunchTimeOut): Added.
	(-launchForDomain:): Modified to create a timer that checks whether launch 
	notifications are received in time for AppKit-based applications.
	(-postTaskLaunched): Modified to call SCSystem directly rather than 
	indirectly through the distributed notification center.
	(-taskLaunched:): Modified to only catch 
	NSWorkspaceDidLaunchApplicationNotification here and calls -[SCSystem 
	noteApplicationLaunched:] indirectly through -postTaskLaunched. Previously 
	-[SCSystem noteApplicationLaunched] handled these notifications directly.
	(-taskTerminated:): Always set launchFinished to NO when a task terminates.
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	Moved _launchQueueScheduled reset so it happens only when the launch queue 
	becomes empty.
	(-noteApplicationLaunched:): Rewritten to be simpler and and safer. Do not 
	handle NSWorkspaceDidLaunchApplicationNotification directly now, but 
	SCTask does it and notifies us with -postTaskLaunched.

2008-02-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* etoile.desktop: Made the xsession file truly compliant with Desktop 
	file spec by removing a newline which prevents GDM to start an Etoile 
	session on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.

2007-07-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* SystemTaskList.plist: Added make_services.

2007-06-30  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* Use 'pkg-config --cflags dbus-1` and `pkg-config --libs dbus-1`
	  for headers and libraries. Fix bug 9332.

2007-06-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* SystemTaskList.plist: Added AZSwitch, Corner and Idle. Made OuterSpace hidden.

2007-05-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Fixed buggy task management which occurs when an invalid launch path is
	specified in SystemTaskList.plist. Found it because OuterSpace is part of
	SystemTaskList but not included in trunk build process. Log out was broken
	as a side-effect.
	* SCTask.m: Fixed to return nil rather than an invalid task when the launch
	path cannot be resolved.
	* EtoileSystem: Modified to check a task isn't nil before adding it to the
	process list.

2007-05-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* SystemTaskList.plist: Added OuterSpace.

2007-05-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* GNUmakefile: Added ETOILE_CORE_MODULE (replace 
	GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN). Removed ADDITIONAL_OBJCFLAGS now part of 
	etoile.make.

2007-04-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileSystem.m: 
	(-powerOff:): Improved to check whether reboot and shutdown are supported
	and reporting error to the user otherwise.
	(-reportPowerOffError:): New method.
	(-suspend): Improved to report error if suspend cannot be completed.
	(-replyToLogOutOrPowerOff:): Modified to trigger reboot or shutdown when
	the operation underway isn't a simple logout.
	* SCHardware.m: Added. New set of functions to talk to host system and 
	hardware through DBus/HAL combo. Includes detailed documentation on Linux 
	suspend support.
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to link dbus library.

2007-04-14  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m: 
	New ivar _operation. New constants SCNoneOperation, SCRebootOperation, 
	SCShutDownOperation, SCLogOutOperation.
	Removed powerOffRequest flag. 
	(-terminateSession):
	(-logOut):
	(-powerOff:):
	(-suspend):
	(-extendPowerOffBy:):
	New documented methods but only the first two are fully functional.
	(-logOutAndPowerOff:): Removed. Moved most code to -terminateSession.
	Also shut down warnings about -initWithArguments.

2007-04-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileSystem.m: Finished the big part of remaining reindenting and 
	documentation to be done.

	* EtoileSystem.m
	(-findConfigFileAndStartUpdateMonitoring):
	(-checkConfigFileUpdate):
	(-processTerminated:)
	More reindenting and documentation work. Fixed -checkConfigFileUpdate not
	be run when some tasks are on the way to be launch.

	* ApplicationManager.h: Minor adjustments.
	* EtoileSystem.h: New ivar _launchQueueScheduled.
	* EtoileSystem.m (-synchronizeProcessesWithConfigFile): Modified indenting
	to match Etoile guidelines and reformatted the code to look better. Also
	reintroduced live processes synchronization with the config file thanks
	to flag _launchQueueScheduled.

2007-04-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.m: Made the code more solid by initializing all vars 
	and by logging warnings for all incorrect returned values (not in their 
	boundaries). Lot of work on public and private documentation. Finished to
	update indenting for -terminateAllApplicationsOnOperation: especially.
	Few cleanings of the code (like variable name or order of substatements).

2007-04-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.m: Almost fully updated the indenting to be compliant 
	with Etoile coding guidelines. Improved documentation.

2007-03-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.m:
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	* SCTask.m: 
	Shut down all compilation warnings except one in ApplicationManager. This
	corrects the potential bug in SCTask outlined in #8729

2007-03-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* SystemTaskList.plist: Updated to include AZDock and AZBackground.

2007-03-18  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* WorkspaceCommKit/NSWorkspace+Communication.m:
	Do not check for GSWorkspaceApplication because in any case,
	it will not work. (See source code for more explanation).

2007-03-18  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* SCTask.h:
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	Change arguments to NSArray type since it is what SystemTaskList.plist has.
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	Support arguments.

2007-03-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Last part of the update to support both sequential and parallel launch of
	tasks.
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	New config file keys Priority and OnStart.
	Written documentation for the keys supported in the config file.
	New ivars _launchQueue, _launchGroup.
	(-initWithArguments:): Added _launchQueue ivar init and moved config file
	monitoring start to -run.
	(-run): Moved the process starting to -applicationDidFinishLaunching:
	(-applicationDidFinishLaunching:): Heavily modified to include config file
	monitoring start and main method calls to launch processes by priority 
	order. Also registers for task termination notifications.
	(-noteApplicationLaunched:, 
	-processQueueWithProcesses:, 
	-processGroupQueueWithProcessQueue:,

	Priority and OnStart when creating task objects.
	Improved or modified a bit logging statements across the file.
	* SCTask.h:
	* SCTask.m: 
	New ivar launchFinished.
	(+taskWithLaunchPath:priority:onStart:onDemand:withUserName:): Modified to
	observe not all termination notifications but only the one related to 
	ourself.
	(-taskLaunched:): Modified to update new launchFinished flag.
	(-taskTerminated:): Modified to take in account when a task exits before 
	having finished to launch.
	(-postTaskLaunched): New method.
	* SystemTaskList.plist: Updated to include Priority number and OnStart 
	boolean. Removed background process.
	As a side effect, this update should fix bug #8729 and #8695

2007-02-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	First part of an update to support both sequential and parallel launch of
	tasks.
	* SCTask.h:
	* SCTask.m: 
	New ivars launchPriority, launchOnStart and isNSApplication.
	(+taskWithLaunchPath:): Updated to take in account name change of the 
	designated factory method.
	(+taskWithLaunchPath:priority:onStart:onDemand:withUserName:): Renamed and

2007-02-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileSystem.m 
	(-run): Modified to set NSApp delegate.
	(-applicationDidFinishLaunching:): New method for debugging purpose 
	currently.
	(-findConfigFileAndStartUpdateMonitoring): NS_MESSAGE fix yet another
	time. This corrects bizarre crash happening every time System tries to
	display an alert panel.
	* etoile.desktop: Modified to reference etoile script rather than 
	etoile_system itself. (More to come about this in a next commit)


2007-02-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.m (-init):
	Fixed a crash that often prevents to run the session more than few 
	seconds. The problem lays in NS_MESSAGE use, that's why I replaced it
	by the usual verbose code (as I already did for 
	-checkTerminatingLaterApplicationWithName: invocation).
	* SystemTaskList.plist: Modified to take care of AZBackground launch.

2006-12-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.h:
	* ApplicationManager.m:
	Minor code cleaning (better coding style conformance). Added or improved 
	most of method documentation (involved some markup changes to use gsdoc 
	format).

2006-12-17  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* main.m: Avoid app icon.

2006-12-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Updated for new ivars.
	(+taskWithLaunchPath:onDemand:withUserName:): Updated to get notified 
	itself of its own termination.
	(+taskWithTask:):
	(-runInterval):
	(-launchFailureCount):
	(-taskTerminated:):
	New methods.
	(-launch:): Overriden NSTask method.
	* EtoileSystem.m (-startProcessWithDomain:error:): Modified to relaunch 
	automatically system processes that exit prematurely (like on a crash), 
	yet without getting stuck in starting a process that continously fails to
	launch.

2006-12-16  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* SCTask.h:
	* SCTask.m:
	New files. Moved SCTask code out of EtoileSystem.m.

2006-12-11  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	The commit r1334 introduces full log out support.
	* ApplicationManager.h:
	* ApplicationManager.m:
	New SCSession protocol.
	Removed terminateAllLock ivar. Added replyLock and logOut ivars.
	Extended NSApplication informal protocol with Etoile category, it now
	includes methods defined in EtoileBehavior.
	(-dealloc):
	(-init:):
	ivars related update.
	(+sharedIntance): Now returns instance created by +setUpServerInstance:.
	This is temporary.
	(+setUpServerInstance:):
	(-userApplications): 
	New methods.
	(-noteApplicationTerminated:): Added code to finish the log out when the 
	last running user application exits.
	(-checkTerminatingLaterApplicationWithName:): Fixed and included clean up
	code on log out cancellation.
	(-terminateAllApplicationsOnOperation:): Finished the method that initiates
	the log out. Reworked to act in a purely asynchronous way and match SCSession 
	protocol implemented in EtoileBehavior.
	(-replyToTerminate:info:): New method to let user applications reply to log
	out request.
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	New ivars clientConnection and serverConnection (not yet used).
	(-[SCTask name]): Updated to return application name with extension 
	stripped out (this fixes applications tracking).
	(+setUpServerInstance:): Modified to use our own connection rather than the
	default one, this avoids any conflicts if we open more connections.
	(-run): Modified to start NSApplication run loop, this is needed to display
	alert panels.
	(-maskedProcesses): Put ourself in masked processes.
	(-logOutAndPowerOff:) Removed immediate call to -replyToLogOutOrPowerOff: 
	in order to trigger the full log out procedure.
	(-replyToLogOutOrPowerOff:): Now takes a dictionary as a parameter rather 
	than a string. Error description is now picked in info parameter.
	* main.m: Disabled our own run loop since we now use NSApplication one.

2006-12-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* ApplicationManager.h:
	* ApplicationManager.m:
	New ivars waitedApplications, terminateLaterTimers, terminateAllLock.
	(-dealloc):
	(-init:):
	ivars related update.
	(-checkTerminatingLaterApplicationWithName:): New method to check delayed
	replies and triggered by a timer bound to each application requesting later
	termination.
	(-gracefullyTerminateAllApplicationsOnOperation:): Renamed
	-terminateAllApplicationsOnOperation:. Lot of work to have a proper log out
	support with a delay when an application doesn't reply, before cancelling 
	the log out. Still work in progress and not yet enabled.
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m: 
	Major SCTask rewrite to avoid opentool and openapp for launching. Now smart
	enough to find the executable even with a simple app or tool name.
	(-[SCTask launchWithOpentoolUtility]):
	(-[SCTask launchWithOpenappUtility]):
	Removed.
	(-[SCTask launchForDomain:]): Cleant to match the changes.
	(-[SCTask pathForName:): New method.
	(-[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:onDemand:withUserName:]): Made smarter :-)...
	specially by looking for executable in application bundle. 
	(-stopProcessWithDomain:error:): Modified to terminate tasks more carefully
	and added log statements for debugging purpose.
	(-gracefullyTerminateAllProcessesOnOperation:): Renamed
	-terminateAllProcessesOnOperation: and fixed broken behavior by simply 
	using -stopProcessWithDomain:error:.
	(-logOutAndPowerOff:): Fixed limited log out support currently available. 
	Modified to support asynchronous replies needed by ApplicationManager.
	(-replyToLogOutOrPowerOff:): New method called asynchronously by 
	ApplicationManager to let System knows it should finish or cancel log out.

2006-12-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* EtoileWorkspaceServerInfo.plist: Removed.
	* SystemTaskList.plist: Added.
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m: 
	Updated to use SystemTaskList (the system tasks aren't harcoded anymore in 
	SCSystem).

2006-10-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* WorkspaceCommKit/GNUmakefile.preamble: Modified to redefine PROJECT_DIR 
	properly, so WorkspaceCommKit is exported by etoile.make (patch by Frederic
	Point). Services/Private/GNUmakefile modified too.

2006-10-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	This update enables requesting running applications the possibility to
	log out, if they don't reply, they get killed. Very experimental!
	* Controller.h:
	* Controller.m:
	Deleted.
	* ApplicationManager.h:
	* ApplicationManager.m:
	Added LGPL license notices.
	(-applicationShouldTerminateOnOperation:)
	(-gracefullyTerminateAllApplicationsOnOperation:): 
	Updated to match SCSystem changes. Now retrieve SCSystem instance directly
	by calling -serverInstance instead of -sharedInstance which doesn't work
	locally at this time.
	(-gracefullyTerminateAllApplicationsOnOperation:): Modified to use private
	NSWorkspace method -_connectApplication: instead of WorkspaceCommKit 
	similarly named method.
	* EtoileSystem.h:
	* EtoileSystem.m:
	Added some debugging logs. New 'path' ivar in SCTask. New constant 
	EtoileSystemServerName, was EtoileWorkspaceServerAppName previously in
	Controller.m.
	(-[SCTask dealloc]):
	(-[SCTask path]):
	(-[SCTask name]):
	New methods.
	(-[SCSystem startProcessWithDomain:error:]): Improved to avoid starting 
	several processes per domain.
	(-[SCSystem maskedProcesses]): Renamed -hiddenProcesses method since such
	tasks could be visible to the user (like MenuServer), they should just be
	invisible to ApplicationManager.
	(-[SCSystem gracefullyTerminateAllProcessesOnOperation:): Added early code 
	skeleton.

2006-10-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    Update to provide basic session management. At this time only 'log out' is
    supported in an unclean way (just by telling etoile_system to exit without
    asking running applications to quit), yet the implementation for such
    features is already here. This commit also introduces far more evolved 
    process handling, system related tasks can now be controlled at run time 
    with a config plist file.
    * Controller.h:
    * Controller.m:
    * ApplicationManager.h:
    * ApplicationManager.m:
    * EtoileWorkspaceServerInfo.plist:
    * NSArrayAdditions.h:
    * NSArrayAdditions.m:
    * NSDictionaryAdditions.h:
    * NSDictionaryAdditions.m:
    * NSSetAdditions.h:
    * NSSetAdditions.m:
    Added code written by Saso Kiselkov modified to fit into System.
    * WorkspaceCommKit:
    Added a private framework to allow communication between MenuServer and 
    System. Should be replaced/merged into CoreObject once available. This 
    small framework was written by Saso Kiselkov too.
    * main.m: Modified to use the default run loop rather than a new one.
    * GNUmakefile: Updated to take care of WorkspaceCommKit as a subproject and
    to link gnustep-gui as a temporary solution (giving access to NSWorkspace
    and applications related stuff).
    * EtoileSystem.h:
    * EtoileSystem.m:
    Massive update including new ivars and a bunch of new methods taken from
    Saso code.
    (SetNonNullError()): New helper function to report error.
    (-[SCTask  isHidden]):
    (-[SCTask isStopped]):
    New methods with related ivars.
    (+[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:onDemand:withUserName:): Updated to init new 
    ivars.
    (-[SCTask terminate]): Overriden NSTask method to set 'stopped' ivar value
    properly on termination request.
    (+setUpServerInstance:): Modified to set the connection delegate.
    (-initWithArguments:): Modified to call 
    -findConfigFileAndStartUpdateMonitoring and 
    -synchronizeProcessesWithConfigFile. Removed gdomap from launched processes
    since it needs to be run as root and this isn't true for etoile_system at
    this time.
    (-startProcessWithDomain:)
    (-restartProcessWithDomain:)
    (-stopProcessWithDomain:)
    (-suspendProcessWithDomain:):
    Modified the methods to take an error paramater in the form of an extra
    'error: (NSError **)error' part at the end of the signature.
    (-startProcessWithDomain:): Don't start a process already running and 
    add notifications observing to have feedback when the process will die.
    (-loadConfigList): Updated to call -checkConfigFileUpdate.
    (-hiddenProcess)
    (-gracefullyTerminateAllProcessesOnOperation:)
    (-logOutAndPowerOff:):
    (-startProcessWithUserFeedbackForDomain:)
    (-findConfigFileAndStartUpdateMonitoring)
    (-checkConfigFileUpdate)
    (-synchronizeProcessesWithConfigFile)
    (-processTerminated:):
    New methods.
    
2006-08-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.desktop: Added xsessions file following Freedesktop 'Desktop Entry' 
    spec and to be used with GDM, KDM etc. Trying Etoile should be enjoyable 
    now :-)

2006-08-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * EtoileSystem.h: Documented Task/Process Info Dictionary Schema (used for 
    config files stored in plist form). Removed superfluous SCEtoileSystem
    protocol.
    (-loadConfigList):
    (-saveConfigList):
    (+serverInstance):
    (+setUpServerInstance:):
    Declared new methods.
    * EtoileSystem.m: Documented Main System Process List. Morphed NSTask
    category in a new SCTask class and replaced dot separator in domains by the 
    usual slash.
    (+[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:]): Updated.
    (+[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:onDemand:withUserName]):
    (-[SCTask launchForDomain:]): Replaced dot separator in domains by the 
    usual slash.
    (-[SCTask launchOnDemand]):
    (+[SCSystem initialize]):
    (+[SCSystem serverInstance]):
    (+[SCSystem setUpServerInstance:]):
    New methods.
    (+[SCSystem sharedInstance]): Fixed to return a singleton (or precisely a
    proxy for the singleton located on the server side), was wrongly returning
    a simple instance.
    (-[SCSystem init]): Updated to use SCTask now and replaced dot separator in
    domains by the usual slash.
    (-[SCSystem run]): Modified to launch only tasks not used on demand.
    (-[SCSystem startProcessWithDomain:]): Removed a bunch of error logging 
    code that isn't useful. Replaced 'NSTask' references by 'SCTask'.
    (-[SCSystem restartProcessWithDomain:): Introduced a new boolean 'stopped'
    to make the code more readable.
    (-[SCSystem registerProcessForDomain:): 
    (-[SCSystem unregisterProcessForDomain:
    Removed SCEtoileSytem protocol.
    * main.m: Modified to properly set up a server instance for SCSystem and 
    a run loop that avoids the daemon exits immediately.
    * GNUmakefile: Minor update to disable direct install in /usr/local/bin, we
    rather let the setup script (to be committed in trunk/Etoile) creating a 
    link in /usr/local/bin or elsewhere.

2006-03-05  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * ChangeLog:
    * COPYING:
    * EtoileSystem.h:
    * EtoileSystem.m:
    * main.m:
    * GNUmakefile:
    Initial import of EtoileSystem tool which owns any running Etoile system.
