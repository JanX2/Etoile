    * etoile.desktop: Added xsessions file following Freedesktop 'Desktop Entry' 
    spec and to be used with GDM, KDM etc. Trying Etoile should be enjoyable 
    now :-)

    * EtoileSystem.h: Documented Task/Process Info Dictionary Schema (used for 
    config files stored in plist form). Removed superfluous SCEtoileSystem
    protocol.
    (-loadConfigList):
    (-saveConfigList):
    (+serverInstance):
    (+setUpServerInstance:):
    Declared new methods.
    * EtoileSystem.m: Documented Main System Process List. Morphed NSTask
    category in a new SCTask class and replaced dot separator in domains by the 
    usual slash.
    (+[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:]): Updated.
    (+[SCTask taskWithLaunchPath:onDemand:withUserName]):
    (-[SCTask launchForDomain:]): Replaced dot separator in domains by the 
    usual slash.
    (-[SCTask launchOnDemand]):
    (+[SCSystem initialize]):
    (+[SCSystem serverInstance]):
    (+[SCSystem setUpServerInstance:]):
    New methods.
    (+[SCSystem sharedInstance]): Fixed to return a singleton (or precisely a
    proxy for the singleton located on the server side), was wrongly returning
    a simple instance.
    (-[SCSystem init]): Updated to use SCTask now and replaced dot separator in
    domains by the usual slash.
    (-[SCSystem run]): Modified to launch only tasks not used on demand.
    (-[SCSystem startProcessWithDomain:]): Removed a bunch of error logging 
    code that isn't useful. Replaced 'NSTask' references by 'SCTask'.
    (-[SCSystem restartProcessWithDomain:): Introduced a new boolean 'stopped'
    to make the code more readable.
    (-[SCSystem registerProcessForDomain:): 
    (-[SCSystem unregisterProcessForDomain:
    Removed SCEtoileSytem protocol.
    * main.m: Modified to properly set up a server instance for SCSystem and 
    a run loop that avoids the daemon exits immediately.
    * GNUmakefile: Minor update to disable direct install in /usr/local/bin, we
    rather let the setup script (to be committed in trunk/Etoile) creating a 
    link in /usr/local/bin or elsewhere.
