Just playing with Corner and ScriptKit.. hopefully will turn in to some sort of overlay shelf mockup.

- run "./register.sh" to set up the Corner listener.
- run xcompmgr
- run Corner
- do "make" and "./OverlayShelf.app/OverlayShelf"

Usage:
- move mouse to bottom-left corner of screen to open shelf
- try dragging the images around
- the other screen corners close the shelf

ScriptKit is very cool!
