This is Installer.app, a package installer for GNUstep.

It aims to provide easy instalation of packages, be they the native
packages of the underlying system (debs, rpms, etc) or, in the future,
GNUstep packages (that follow the NeXTSTEP/MacOSX package format).

Any questions/sugestions are appreaciated :)
