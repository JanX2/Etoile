	* Fixed VT100Screen:-setNewLine to redraw whole screen if buffer is full
	* Protecting PTYTextView:-refresh with locking datasource
	* Fixed memory leak in VT100Screen:-setString
	* Not using NSData in PTYTask:+_processReadThread. Instead passing raw char buffer.

2006-03-02  ujwal

	* Fixed VT100Screen:-numberOfLines to guarantee that it does not
	  report more lines than it actually has.

2006-03-02  fabian

    * Fixed VT100Screen::eraseInDisplay behavior.
    * Fixed CPU usage issue.
    * Changed VT100Screen::setNewLine so that we are not redrawing all
      characters in the case of a scrolling.
    
2006-03-01  fabian

    * Fixed a memory leak in VT100Screen
    * Changed the timing behavior of PTYSession and PTYTextView. Now we use
      the system clock, and the blinking is no longer associated with the
      input.
    * Changed the alloc/dealloc code so that now VT100Screen, VT100Terminal,
      and PTYTask objects are no longer retaining each other. All alloc and
      dealloc of these objects is done in PTYSession.
      
2006-03-01	ujwal

	* Fixed bug in PTYTextView:-drawRect in calculation of foreground color.

2006-02-28	ujwal

	* Rewrite of VT100Screen. Screen and scrollback contents are held in a single
	  contiguous buffer with pointers maintaining position of screen and scrollback 
	  tops. Defined a data type "screen_char_t" to hold unichar value, foreground 
	  color, and background color.

2006-02-23	ujwal

	* Tagged source tree for RC_0_8_2
	* Clearing buffer now does NOT clear last line. Last line now becomes first line.

2006-02-21	ujwal

	* Fixed bug in PTYTextView: -contentFromX...

2006-02-21	dnedrow
	* Updated doco to clarify session behavior reported as bug in #1011334.

2006-02-20	ujwal

	* Rolled back _updateDisplayThread change in PseudoTerminal since that broke the
	  the anti-idle processing in non-current sessions.
	* Removed explicit session of next/previous session in PseudoTerminal:-closeSession. This 
	  is handled by the tabview.

2006-02-19	ujwal

	* _updateDisplayThread in PseudoTerminal updates only current session since
	  other sessions are off screen anyway.

2006-02-18	ujwal

	* Acquiring screenLock in VT100Screen when resizing.
	* Reduced idle CPU usage by about 90% by using a semaphore to signal data processing thread.
	* Saving and restoring width of Bookmarks drawer.
	* Updated Help files.

2006-02-17	ujwal

	* Some code cleanup.
	* Moved iTermNumberOfSessionsDidChange notification from closeSession to tabViewDidChangeNumberOfTabViewItems.
	* Fixed deadlock between VT100Terminal and PTYTextView.

2006-02-14  fabian

    * Bug fixes for crashes when sessions are closed.
    
2006-02-13  fabian

    * Removed NSConnection from PTYTask all together
    
2006-02-12	ujwal
	* Fixed memory leak in PTYTask.
	* Moved event handlers for NSMouseEntered and NSMouseExited to PTYWindow.
	* Using separate thread in PTYSession to process data read from file descriptor in PTYTask. When data is read, the 
	  PTYTask instance justs appends data to the STREAM in VT100Terminal. The separate thread in PTYSession now reads 
	  the STREAM and processes data.

2006-02-06  fabian

    * Updated website files for the new release.

2006-02-06	dnedrow

	* Set default terminal type to ANSI rather than VT100. This should
	  reduce the numerous support message re: "lack of color" support
          in the shell (eg. ls -G).

2006-02-05	dnedrow

	* Updated NIB PreferencePanels to reflect Rendezvous->Bonjour namechange.
	* Fixes for mismatched signedness warnings in PTYSession.m.
	* Corrected an XCODE 2.2 warning re: boolean assignment used for while()
	  in iTermApplicationDelegate.m.
	* Disabled prebinding in default XCode project to clear linker warnings
	  when compiling for UB targets. Can be enabled as needed for 10.2 or 
	  10.3 builds.

2006-02-05	ujwal

	* Fixed outlet bug in German NIB that caused drawer not to open.
	* Removed unnecessary code in iTermApplication.m 

2006-02-03  fabian

	* Fixed "can't save changes" bug.

	  before it's sent to the browser.
	* Updated zh_CN and zh_TW files.
	
2006-01-07	dnedrow
	* Converted project to XCode 2.2.1.
	* Set project to default to Universal Binary.
	
2005-09-21	fabian

	* Added contribution from Damon Parker into Resource page of the website.

2005-05-04	fabian

	* Changes in decoding_string(). Now we do not ignore the whole line after receiving an invalid code.
	
2005-04-16	ujwal

	* All key input is checked for mapping.
	* Preferences are saved to disk on hitting OK.

2005-04-09	ujwal

	* Removed bouncing icon feature. Not a good idea for a terminal.
	* Incorporated Geoff Reedy's patch for xterm mouse reporting with minor changes.
	* Incorporated Rob Warner's patch to toggle transparency.

	* 0.8.1 release

2005-04-03	ujwal

	* Version number is 0.8.1.

2004-11-26	fabian

	* Updated German localization, provided by Felix KŸhne.
	
2004-11-20  ujwal

	* Re-organized some of the sizing code to make it work better when iTerm is embedded 
	  in other applications.

2004-11-14  ujwal

	* Re-organized some code.

2004-11-09  ujwal
	
	* Fixed more reverse video issues on OpenVMS: in [VT100Screen: -eraseInLine]; if 
	  entire line is erased, it gets default foreground and background colors.


2004-10-27  ujwal

	* Fixed bug in nested bookmark search.

2004-10-22	fabian

	* Updated Japanese nib files using translation provided by OHKAWA Yuichi.
	* Updated zh_CN, zh_TW, Japanese, Korean, French, German nib files for next controls.
	
2004-10-20  ujwal
	
	* Fixed more reverse video issues on OpenVMS: in [VT100Screen: -eraseDisplay], all 
	  erased characters get default foreground and background colors.

2004-10-20  ujwal

	* Fixed reverse video problem in OpenVMS again. Hopefully, this time it 
	  is the correct fix. In [VT100Screen: -scrollUp] and [VT100Screen: -scrollDown], 
	  new lines have DEFAULT_FG_COLOR_CODE DEFAULT_BG_COLOR_CODE for foreground and 
	  background colors respectively instead of using the terminal's current fg and bg 
	  colors. I am not sure why OpenVMS does not set the video properties appropriately 
	  when scrolling.

2004-10-10  ujwal

	* Added support to display Bookmarks in drawer of terminal window.

2004-10-03  ujwal

	* Periodically refreshing autorelease pool in display update thread to avoid 
	  memory leak from autoreleased objects.
	* Fixed code for numeric enter from \012 to \015.

2004-09-25  ujwal
	
	* Fixed problem when PTYSession: -keyDown is never called when numeric or function 
	  keys were pressed. This messes up switching between application and numeric 
	  keypad modes. Now PTYTextView: -keyDown: invokes PTYSession: -keyDown: when 
	  numeric or function keys are pressed.	  
	* Fixed printing to NOT wrap text.	
	* Added support to launch command line tools from Finder.

2004-09-12  fabian
	
	* More fix for "Font Size Follows Window Resize" option. Largely works now,
	  but maximization still has weird behavior sometimes.
	  
2004-09-07  ujwal

	* setHidden method is invoked only if target view supports it (>= 10.3).
	* Added keybinding action for numeric enter key.

2004-09-02	fabian
	
	* Added "Maximize Vertically Only" option.
	* Added "Font Size Follows Window Resize" option (not working well yet)
	
2004-08-30	fabian
	
	* Removed unused [PseudoTerminal setCharWidth:(int)width height:(int)height];

2004-08-04  ujwal

	* Cmd-click on selection is activated only if mouseDown and mouseUp are 
	  in the same location.

2004-07-07  ujwal

	* Reimplemented print-to-ansi feature to use standard printing. Should 
	  also fix any encoding issues.

2004-07-05  ujwal

	* Added support to drag selection from iTerm window.
	* Added support to specify a bookmark as default.

2004-06-15  fabian

2004-05-26  ujwal

	* Added an option to enable/disable Rendezvous.

2004-05-24  ujwal

	* Added support for services.

2004-05-19  ujwal

	* Made horizontal spacing parameter an "int" instead of a "float" since 
	  "float" was making the fonts look blurry. Spacing changes will be 
	  choppier, so we will need to revisit that.

2004-05-17  ujwal

	* Put back in fabian's fix for crash when closing window too fast. 
	  Object de-allocation does work correctly. It just happens when the 
	  next event is processed like a key or mouse event. However, it still 
	  leaves behind a zombie shell process that goes away only when iTerm 
	  is quit.

2004-05-15  fabian

    * Selection now occurs when mouseDown instead of mouseUp.
    
2004-05-11  ujwal
	
	* Added support to set cursor color and cursor text color from applescript.

2004-05-08  ujwal

	* Fixed printing.

2004-05-08  ujwal

	* Re-implemented display update thread using NSThread instead of NSTimer 
	  to avoid posting frequent events on main run loop. Hopefully this 
	  should reduce CPU usage seen on laptops. Also, the thread is called 
	  from the controlling Pseudoterminal instead of in each tab. Thread 
	  updates all tabs in the controlling PseudoTerminal. This should reduce 
	  the number of threads to one per PseudoTerminal.

2004-04-27  fabian

    * Added support for double/triple click and drag to copy.
    * Fixes for shift-to-extend-selection
    * Now Command-selection opens what is selected in a browser.
    
2004-04-26  ujwal
	
	* Fixed resize bug in VT100Screen.

2004-04-24  ujwal

	  bug in toolbar visibility toggling.
	* Added support for mapping the help key.

2004-04-20  ujwal

	* Added an option to have middle mouse button paste from clipboard.
	* Added an option to disable bold font rendering in display profile 
	  and config panel.

    * Fixes of Japanaese and German translatons.
    
2004-04-18  ujwal

	* Potential fix for dead key and key repeat issue.

2004-04-16  ujwal

	* Honoring anti-aliasing for bold also. We don't use strokewidth for 
	  bold when antialias is off since it looks ugly. Instead, we use 
	  the old method of redrawing the character offset by 1 pixel.
	  
	* Added a screen lock API to VT100Screen.

2004-04-15  ujwal

	* Fixed size of window in setWindowSize when tabs are at bottom.

2004-04-14  fabian

    * Updated website files.
    
2004-04-13  ujwal

	* Updated help pages.
	* Made changes to horizontal character spacing inconfig panel update smoother.

2004-04-11  ujwal
	
	* PTYTask is back to blocking read since we are not doing any 
	  idle processing anymore. This should cut down onthe number 
	  of select calls.

2004-04-11  fabian

    * Check in correct Japanese localization.
    
2004-04-11  ujwal

	* Made config panel a floating window. Changes are applied immediately 
	  to the active session.
	* Added back in support for bookmark shortcuts.

2004-04-10  ujwal

	* Removed obsolete code activating fonts.
	* Migrating name, command, and working directories of old 
	  addressbook to new format. Default profiles will be used.
	* Subclassed NSApplication to override sendEvent: so that 
	  custom key bindings with command key mask would work correctly. 
	  Take care not to define key mappings that override something 
	  important like cmd-q.

2004-04-08  ujwal

	* Updated ProjectBuilder file.

2004-04-06  fabian

	* A fix for Jaguar incompatibility with NSStrokeWidthAttributeName

	  Panther systems and above.
	* Added controls for character spacing in config panel.

2004-03-24  ujwal

	  by adjusting position only for graphical glyphs, and NOT for ALL GLYPHS on 
	  in the line.

	  preference can now be turned off for fonts that have native support for 
	  graphical characters.

      before a terminal view can be created.

2003-07-17	ujwal

2003-06-13	ujwal

    * Fixed bug in VT100Typesetter line bounds calculation where

    * VT100Terminal does not set NSCharacterWidthAttributeName for ascii text.
      This is so that the custom typesetter can easily check 
      for double width characters by just looking for the existence of the 
      attribute.
      
    * Created VT100LayoutManager, a NSLayoutManager subclass to speed up 
      some operations such as window resizing.

2003-06-09	fabian

        1. speed is much slower (~2x), 
        2. change font with a large scrollback buffer takes for
           ever (due to re-layout, I think).

    * Re-implemented window resizing.

2003-04-23	ujwal

    * Using real bell icon instead of warning sign.

    * Clearing bell on user input.
    
2003-04-21	ujwal
    
    * Set document cursor of scrollview to arrow cursor so that 
      the I-Beam cursor is disabled. Removed all other cursor related 
      code.

2003-04-20	ujwal
    
    * When preferences are read, if the selected font is not 
      found, fall back on the default fixed pit font for the user.
      
    * Increased the width of the encoding combo-box in all nibs.

2003-04-18	ujwal

    * Using named color contants instead of building our own 
      in VT100Terminal.
      
    * Fixed a bug in setting foreground and background colors at 
      the same time.

2003-04-15	ujwal

      since a user reported problems after an unhide operation.

2003-04-11	fabian
    * Fixed a bug that causes iTerm to hang when illege UTF-8
      characters encountered. We now display a '#' whenever
      encoding translations failed
      
2003-04-11	ujwal

    * Setting cursor color to a mix of foreground and 
      background colors when window is inactive.

2003-04-10	fabian
    * Fixed some bugs in setNeedsDisplayInRect of PTYTextView
    * Removed background attributes when background is default
    * Fixed a email error on website

2003-04-10	ujwal

    * Put back in the code for not auto-scrolling down 
      on new output if the user has scrolled up. It had 
      been interfering with the vttest program. Now we 
      auto-scroll down when the window size changes, so 
      vttest largely works.

2003-04-09	ujwal

    * Preliminary support for print-to-ansi.
    
    * Incorporated French nib files into project.

2003-04-08	fabian
    * Added French localization provided by Matt Anton
    
2003-04-07	ujwal

    * Fixed a namespace collision bug in PTYTask.
    
    * Fixed linewrap bug in VT100Screen.

2003-04-05	ujwal

    * Fixed write problem when prompted for passwords.
    
    * Now explicitly setting PATH to something sensible 
      since the default includes the user's home directory.
    
    * Implemented ESC [?40h (allow 132<->80 column mode).
    
2003-04-02	ujwal

    * Fixed a problem that was causing iTerm to hang when 
      a large piece of text was being pasted.

2003-04-01	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in text input
    * Applied the URL parsing into ARRAY code
    * Added an indictor in About box to show if iTerm is
      build under ARRAY mode or BUFFER mode
    
2003-04-01	ujwal

    * Now dynamically displaying window size as window is 
      being resized.

2003-03-31	ujwal

    * Made URL parsing in PTYTextView slightly more 
      intelligent.

2003-03-30	ujwal

    * When dragging a text clipping onto iTerm, we 
      don't insert the file name of the clipping since 
      the contents are inserted.

2003-03-28	ujwal
    * Made addressbook non-modal.
    * Fixed a crash in showing preferences window.
    * Fixed bug in changing font for addressbook entries.

2003-03-28	fabian
    * Fixed bugs in selection
    * Fixed context menu
    * Fixed wrong setDirtyLine calls in VT100Screen
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Screen that causes duplicated lines
    * "Save as" now is working, we need a new print function
    * Fixed a crashing bug in "Save Config"
    * Fixed browse and mail in PTYTextView
    * Made selection invalid if text is changed
    
2003-03-27	ujwal

    * Protected some ARRAY specific code in #if USE_CUSTOM_DRAWING
      ...#endif so that BUFFER code does not crash.
      
    * Fixed bug in loading preferences nib.
      

2003-03-27	fabian
    * Bug fixes in ARRAY mode
    * We periodically scroll to the end to reduce amount
      of redraw when large trunk of data come in.
    
2003-03-26	fabian
    * Bug fixes in ARRAY mode
    * No long uses periodic update
    * Refresh now only updates the necessary part of screen
    
2003-03-26	ujwal

    * Created a new target "iTerm Framework" in the 
      project. This is the core of iTerm.app. The 
      iTerm application target just contains the 
      entry point source file and images. It then 
      links against the iTerm framework. This enables 
      other applications to link against iTerm framework 
      to embed iTerm functionality. 
      
    * Regrouped Preference and AddressBook elements into 
      separate NIB files. Created AddressBookWindowController 
      class.

2003-03-25	fabian
    * PTYTextView is now a subclass of NSView under ARRAY 
      mode. Text input works properly. 
    * Working selection and copy/paste 
        
2003-03-22	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    
    * Added option-click support to position cursor.
    
    * Added keyboard shortcut to "Clear Buffer"

2003-03-20	fabian

    * Imported all the website files into the project
    * New key combination for scrolling:
        cmd-Up/Down arrow: scroll one line up/down
        shift-cmd-Up/Down arrow: scroll one pague up/down
    * Added an alert window after configuration is saved.
    * Added shortcut option for address entry.
        Control-Option-Key: Open in new tab
        Shift-Control-Option-Key: Open in new window
      (not working when some input method is being used)
    
2003-03-19	fabian
    * Fixed some AddressBook interface issues
    * Corrected typos in Korean localizations
    * Updated help files

2003-03-18	fabian
    * Added Korean localization provided by TaeYoung Oh
    * Updated Chinese nib files for new option.

2003-03-18	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    * Added explicit preference to warn on quitting 
      or closing a window/tab.
      
2003-03-14	fabian
    * Decrease the brightness of default color to give it
      more contrast to the highlight
    * Fixed a bug related to input CJK.
    * Updated Japanese nib files by Yuichi OHKAWA
    * Added a screen lock to prevent conflicting update.
    * Fixed a bug in dead key processing
      
2003-03-13	fabian
    * Added a new option to allow opening the bookmarks
      window when startup.
    * Change version number to 0.6.5
    * Localized GPL license statement for zh_CN and zn_TW
    * Fixed a bug in PseudoTerminal.nib, zh_TW
    * Cleaned up unused outlets in PseudoTerminal
    * Changed Bookmarks behavior:
        double click opens a new session
        new window is specified using a switch
    * Correct the yellow
        
2003-03-12	fabian
    * Fixed a bug that causes incorrect process of color.
    * Cleaned up the color code
    * Fixed a bug related to reversed video mode.
    * Changed default black color to pure black.
    * Fixed some timer settings
    
2003-03-11	fabian
    * Changed the color code. Now we no longer have fixed
      bold text color. Instead, it's calculated from the
      base color. So we can choose whatever color we want
      again.
      
2003-03-10	fabian
    * Rewrite the color stuff in emulation code. Now we
      use seperate color table for normal and bold text.
      We now will using high color to indicate bold. Also,
      the color table will make the future implementation
      of customized ANSI color easier.
      Limitations: Any color you select for FG/BG will be
      converted to the closest color in the colorTable.
      Aslo, currently FG color will have no alpha.
    * Fixed a display problem when change FG/BG colors or
      Transparency.
    * Implemented ANSI code VPA and VPR, to fix one user's
      problem with Debian programs.
    * Fixed a blinking bug
    * Implemented ANSI code ECH
      
2003-03-10	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added some missing semi-colons in Chinese strings files.


2003-03-08	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed an issue where '=', '/', and '*' could not be 
      typed from numeric keypad. This was because those 
      keys were mapped to the PF2, PF3, PF4 keys. Now we 
      have a numLock state that is on by default. When 
      state is enabled, numeric keypad has the default 
      operation. When it is disabled, the keys 
      'numlock', '=', '/', and '*' send PF1, PF2, PF3, 
      and PF4 sequences. The state can be toggled by using 
      Cmd-numLock. This behavior is basically the same as 
      that implemented in GLTerm.
      

2003-03-04	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in screen update
    
2003-03-04	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug in changing forground and background color 
      in a session.
      

2003-03-03	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Incorporated Max Horn's patches for a variety of 
      enhancements and fixes for some bugs and memory leaks.
      

2003-03-02	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a screen update bug. Sometimes screen HAS to be 
      updated even if minIndex == [BUFFER length], e.g. when 
      doing ^u on the last line.
      

2003-03-01	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a warning bell orientation bug.
    

2003-02-28	fabian
    * Fixed a bug that cause incorrect screen update
      in BUFFER mode
      
2003-02-27	fabian
    * Fixed cursor code in ARRAY mode
    * Fixed more double-width character stuff in ARRAY mode, 
      display should be fully working now
    * We now use the taller one between font and nafont to
      decide the lineHeight.
    * Fixed bugs in scrollUp and scrollDown in ARRAY mode
    * Added some #ifdef to make code compatible in BUFFER mode.
    
2003-02-26	fabian
    * Fixed general double-width character processing in ARRAY mode
    * Fixed "last line missing" bug in ARRAY mode
    * Fixed "clearBuffer" bug in BUFFER mode
    * Fixed scrolling bug that messes up display in ARRAY mode
    
2003-02-25	fabian
    * Further optimization of BUFFER method by updating
      less portion of screen
    * Fixed a showCursor bug
      
2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added highly experimental code to do custom drawing 
      for high speed. Still very buggy. To enable the 
      code, turn on the USE_CUSTOM_DRAWING flag in 
      PseudoTerminal.m, turn on the DEBUG_USE_ARRAY 
      and turn off the DEBUG_USE_BUFFER flags in VT100Screen.m
      
    * Fixed a problem causing huge CPU usage when displaying 
      the bell in tab. Now displaying only if there is a 
      change.
      

2003-02-24	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed and simplified screen updating code.

2003-02-24	fabian
    * Changed version number to 0.6.4
    * Updated help files
    * Fixed a bug in timerTick
    * Fixed a bug that deals non-ASCII characters wrong.
    * Removed the trigger in keyDown in PTYSession.
    * Added an icon in Tab when a bell is received.
    * Now iTerm removes the warning icon when switching tabs.
    
2003-02-22	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed a bug in resizing tabs and window when closing 
      a session.
      
    * Using smaller icon for popup menu in toolbar when 
      toolbar size mode is NSToolbarSizeModeSmall.
      
    * Further speed optimizations by caching rarely changing 
      character attribute dictionaries. We are also not 
      recreating our data stream in VT100Terminal every 
      time we pick off a token. That is too expensive. 
      We just mark our position in the stream and recreate 
      the stream only when we reach the end.
      

2003-02-21	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Manually firing screen update timer after a keyDown 
      to make user input more responsive.
      
    * Fixed memory leak by properly releasing BUFFER in 
      VT100Screen: -dealloc. Also no need to retain 
      BUFFER after alloc and init.
      
    * Fixed bug in accessing characters in buffer while 
      marking autowrap position.
      

2003-02-21	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in function key mapping: F1~F12
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor. Cleaned overall cursor
      Code.
    * Fixed bugs related to color/font settings in buffer
    * Fixed a bug affecting CJK input
    * Perfromace improvement. Now a buffer is used in
      displaying the text. Significantly improve the
      overall speed. Need more test.
      
2003-02-20	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added and implemented tabViewWillPerformDragOperation 
      tabViewDidPerformDragOperation delegate methods. This 
      gets rid of a visual glitch when doing drag-n-drop 
      within a window with only two tabs.
      

2003-02-19	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for a few xterm character attributes.
    
    * Tabs are dragged only after about 8 pixels to prevent 
      accidental dragging.
    

2003-02-16	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Changed implementation of cursorToX: Y: and 
      cursorToX: in VT100Screen. Was interfering 
      with resize command.
      

2003-02-14	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed encoding bug in PTYsession: -keyDown:
    
    * Workaround for a possible Cocoa bug in copy/paste.
    
    * Changed keyboard shortcuts to navigate sessions 
      from Cmd-1/2 to Cmd [ and Cmd ].
      
      
2003-02-13	fabian
    * Enhanced text input
    * Incorporated Japanese patch from OHKAWA
    
2003-02-12	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added preference to remap DELETE key to BACKSPACE.
    

2003-02-11	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Moved dead key code from PTYSession: -keyDown to 
      PTYTextView: -keyDown since that implements the 
      NSTextInput protocol.
      
    * Fixed a minor problem in VT100Screen: scrollUp 
      where an unwanted "\n" was inserted when 
      CURSOR_Y > SCROLL_BOTTOM.
      
    * Made flag to open session in new window in the toolbar 
      popup menu sticky.
      
    * Added GPL notice to all files.
      

2003-02-10	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support for alternate keypad mode and 
      PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 keys.
      
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Terminal: getCSIParam() 
      where the the paramters would be parsed into 
      incorrect array indices when blank (implied) 
      parameters were encountered. This is was messing 
      up some token processing where the position of 
      the parameters in the array was important like 
      [VT100Screen: -setTopBottom].
      
    * Fixed a cursor display bug in PseudoTerminal: -windowConfigOk.
      

2003-02-10	fabian
    * Cleaned up showCursor code
    * Incorparated Japanese nib files from OHKAWA
    * Fixed a bug in scrollUp
    
2003-02-09	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added drag-and-drop support to the PTYTabView class. 
      Tabs can now be moved within and between windows.
      

2003-02-07	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Workaround for a problem in Bookmarks where the 
      scrollbar was not being activated when it should have 
      been on load. It was being activated only on window 
      resize. Looks like a Cocoa bug, but I put in a 
      workaround of telling the NSTableView that the 
      number of rows had changed after loading the addressbook.
      
    * This time really fixed the cursor updating problem. 
      Root cause was VT100: -deleteCharacters that sometimes 
      caused OLD_CURSOR_INDEX to end up with the incorrect 
      value.
	

2003-02-06	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
    
    * Now displaying tab number in label to make it easier 
      to switch between tabs using function keys.
      
    * Changed version number in Info.plist to 0.6.3.
      

2003-02-05	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in showCursor that causes the loss of
      attributes. That partially solves the double-width
      characters problem.
    * Localized new interface additions for zh_CN and zh_TW.
    * 0.6.3!
      
2003-02-04	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added menu item in tabview contextual menu to move 
      tab to new window.
      
    * Simplified PseudoTerminal code by removing direct 
      references to SCREEN, SCROLLVIEW, TEXTVIEW, TERMINAL, 
      TERM_VALUE. All these operate only on the PTYSession 
      object. Also simplified PseudoTerminal: -setupSession 
      code by moving a bunch of it into addSession which 
      is called by other stuff.
      
    * Fixed multi-line copy paste problem that was caused by
      line feed that is inserted when a command wraps over to 
      the next line. Now marking the position where the line 
      feed is inserted and removing it in the copy operation.
      

2003-02-03	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added submenus to tabview contextual menu. Tabview 
      contextual menu is now built and controlled by 
      the tabview delegate.
      

2003-02-02	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added basic Applescript support. One can now write 
      Applescripts to open one or more default or addressbook 
      sessions in a new tab or window. The syntax is:
      
      To open a new session in a new tab:
      launch session "<session_name>" in tab
      
      To open a new session in a new window:
      launch session "<session_name>" in terminal
      
      The <session_name> is either the name of a stored 
      addressbook session or "default session" for a 
      default session.
      
      Here is a sample Applescript:
      
      tell application "iTerm"
	activate
	launch session "default session" in tab
	launch session "Fink list" in terminal
      end tell
      
      These scripts can then be save as executable scripts.
      
    * Incorporated a modified patch by Aaron Gerber to escape 
      special characters out of a file name when doing a 
      drag-and-drop.
      

2003-01-31	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed bug in showing cursor when going up in command 
      history
      

2003-01-30	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Removed terminal size constraints from Preferences, 
      Configuration panel, and Bookmarks entries. 
      Minimum size is 1x1.
      
    * We don't autoscroll to the bottom on shell output if 
      the user has scrolled up. Typing something on the 
      command line will trigger an autoscroll again.
      

2003-01-29	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Incorporated patch by Aaron Gerber to add a "Cancel" 
      button in the preferences panel.
      
    * Added preference to specify tab position:
      top, left, bottom, right
      

2003-01-27	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Refactored a lot of the addressbook menu building code.
    
    * Added addressbook menu to dock menu.
    

2003-01-25	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Bookmarks window now has Autosave name.
    

2003-01-24	fabian
    * Fixed a bug in VT100Terminal that causes loss of
      character sometimes
    * Fixed bug in PseudoTerminal that makes choosing
      non-ASCII font not working
      
2003-01-23	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed mapping of function keys in VT100Terminal.

    * Refactored toolbar item popup menu to enable it in 
      text only mode.
      
    * Fixed bug in PseudoTerminal: -saveSession where 
      row and column values were swapped.
      
    * Better sunchronization between window and session 
      titles. Tab label width is limited to 20 characters.
      

2003-01-20	fabian
    * New option in preference&bookmarks entry
      Treat NonASCII characters as double width
    * Graphical characters now works for VT100 font
    * Fixed a bug in function key code
    * New SetASCIIString() to process ascii strings and
      old SetString() to handle other(multibytes) strings
    * Cleaned up code in VT100Screen.m
    * bug fixes in SetDoubleString
      
2003-01-20	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      for long command lines.
      
    * Added support for ANSI "Cursor Horizontal Absolute".
      
2003-01-17	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Added support to specify text highlight/selection color 
      in preferences, session settings, and bookmarks.
      

2003-01-16	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Fixed common bugs in insertLines, scrollDown in 
      VT100Screen.

      window when the config session window was closed

2002-12-19	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Updated strings files for Chinese
    
2002-12-16	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

      addressbook popup menu gives similar functionality.
      Ideally, the icon for the popup button should be 
      the addressbook icon, but I couldn't get it to work.
      More research needs to be done on that...

      ended, and session name is enclosed in []

      which makes row/col smaller than it should be
      (this one need more test)
      
2002-12-07	Ujwal S. Setlur <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    * Re-implemented transparency code to affect only text 
     instead of the whole window. Had to subclass NSWindow

      to make layout look better.
