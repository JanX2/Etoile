Terminal (iTerm) TODO

    * Test with new Gorm nib compatibility (eventually convert some nib files gorm ones, in case it is helpful because of current Gorm limitations)
    * Try to launch to know whether the nibs are loading properly
    * Test basic interaction (probably means debugging what is choking)
