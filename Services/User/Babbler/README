Babbler 0.0.1
-------------

Babbler is a simple media player based on GStreamer.
It is designed to play single multimedia stream at a time.
It is more like QuickTime player than iTunes.
If you have trouble playing audio or video with Babbler,
try "gst-launch playbin uri=file:///path_to_your_file" first.
If GStreamer cannot play it, Babbler cannot play it.
