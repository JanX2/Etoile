	* Update to 20061026.

2006-09-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Initial import of Calc.app part, taken from Io release 2006-09-20 and 
	located in addons/ObjcBridge/samples/.
	* Calc.app/Calc: Modified the '#!' line to use ioobjc (our own Io version) 
	instead of the usual 'io' tool.
	* COPYING: Added BSD license (this Io license, then it applies to the
	whole Io repository).
