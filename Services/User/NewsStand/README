This is a fork of Vienna[1]. The codes is derived from svn[2].
The main purpose is to have a usable RSS reader for GNUstep and Etoile[3].
It use TRXML[4] for XML parsing and SimpleWebKit[5] for web page.
For cross-platform purpose, some UI are rewritten into codes and adapt default 
look-and-feel of GNUstep or Cocoa instead of customized views.
In the long run, it may be decomposed into frameworks and components.
Current goal is to have a RSS reader *just work*.
