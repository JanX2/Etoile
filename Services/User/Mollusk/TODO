==================

1. Rewrite main user interface in source code, not in gorm.
   Reason: table view and outline view are needed to be subclass
           in the long run. In that case, it may be easier to do
           everything in source code. And it has the potential to port to
           Cocoa. It is easer to fix problem with text editor than opening
           Gorm to do that. The minor user interface can still be gorm file.

2. 3-pane user interface.
   Reason: most RSS reader uses 3-pane user interface and it is indeed
           easier to use.

3. Load URL asynchronosely.
   Reason: avoiding thread.

4. Use BookmarkKit for feeds.
   Reason: reuse existing components for less maintaince.

5. Use CollectionKit or BookmarkKit for articles (optional).
   Reason: resue existing components for less maintaince.

TODO

+ Hunt nasty crashes!
* Show only selected feeds option doesn't work!

  done:
     * RSSKit/GNUmakefile:
	delete GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT
	* in RSSReader/GNUmakefile, too
     * RSSKit, RSSReader into RSSReader-complete-0.4 instead
	of putting tar.gz into a tar

  half-done:
     * shouldn't there be a service, say (selected text),
	service, rssreader, add feed

  not done:
     * example feeds on homepage for testing
     * icons missfallen, especially '+', '-', 'reload'
	* not so ugly colors, more pale

 erdFerkel
 ---------
   not yet done:
     * Notifications on changed homepages

 Me (guenther)
 -------------
   not yet done:
     * DOAP Support (for freshmeat projects)
     * Support for big blog systems for adding feeds.

 Dirk Olmes
 ----------
   done:
     * Let the user change column width
     * Window: save size (probably NSWindow-setAutosaveFrameName)

   not yet done:
     * Double clicks on feeds should open them in the browser

 Fabien
 ------
   needs to be repeated:
     * Post ANN to discuss
     * GNUmakefile:
	RSSReader_GUI_LIBS = -lRSSKit
        (ProjectCenter doesn't support this)
	* and remove GNUmakefile.p*
     * Crash, if it didn't find browser
     * Name already exists
   
   still need to check:
     * Predefined feeds
     * HP: 'Download latest version now'
     * Does not work with proxies
	* GNUstep bug?
	* ask on discuss
	* also search for GSHTTPPropertyProxyHostKey

 ratmice
 -------
   done:
     * Change icon when new articles arrived
	easy, see NSApplication.h:
	@class NSApplication...
	/*
	 * Setting the application's icon
	 */
	- (void) setApplicationIconImage: (NSImage*)anImage;
	- (NSImage*) applicationIconImage;
     * Minor nitpick:
	in RSSReader/GNUmakefile:
	use $(FND_LIBS) instead of
		-l$(FOUNDATION_LIBRARY_NAME)
