    * Basic RSS functionality
       * Fetching feeds from the web
       * Parsing RSS Feeds
       * Showing headlines
       * Showing the article's descriptions
       * Jumping to the corresponding website

    * Serializing obtained feed-information to hard-disk
    * Managing (Adding, removing) feeds

...and here's a overview over the non-working
   features, ordered by importance:

    * More feed managing
    * Basic filters
    * The last feature, which makes RSS Reader a killer app,
      and which will be added when everything else works. ;-)
