=============
Grr Changelog
=============

Aug-31-2006 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to include etoile.make, this allows to have 
	RSSKit dependency properly handled even when RSSKit hasn't already been 
	installed. By the way, Grr is now included by default in Etoile build
	process.

Aug-3-2006 Guenther Noack
	* Multithreading problems are hopefully all fixed now! w00t! :-)

Mar-19-2006 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx at gmail>
	* Remove .gwdir, created by GWorkspace.app.
	* Remove PC.project.backup, created by ProjectCenter.app.

Mar-18-2006 Guenther Noack
	* A bit of project restructuring (move to Etoile SVN)
	* This ChangeLog file is new, since I formerly wrote down
	  changes in the file that's now named NEWS. For older
	  changes, please refer to that.
