Changelog
=========

0.6.1-2 16.1.05
	Production release. Changes were only done to RSSKit between 0.6.1-1
	and 0.6.1-2. See the RSSKit changelog for details.

0.6.1-1 15.1.05
	Strictly a developer-release, completely done by Yen-Ju Chen
	The Gorm file is now split up into several smaller parts, which
	makes it more flexible and component-oriented. Thanks a lot! :-)
	
0.6.1 6.1.05
	Bugfix release

	Bugs fixed:
	- In 0.6 some article bodys were mistakenly replaced by
	  'strange' description strings for the XML nodes. That's
	  fixed.
	- Exception on unsuccesful browser execution is caught.
	- Existing articles aren't replaced by new versions any more.
	  (They were marked as unread again, which stopped users
	   from effectively use the read-flag. :->)

	Not yet done:
	- OSX support still pending. Got everything to compile, but
	  Interface was still lacking. Then I accidentally removed
	  the project. :-(
	- When compiling Grr.app, I experienced that RSSKit needs
	  to be installed before Grr.app will compile. Install this
	  way: cd RSSKit ; gmake install ; cd .. ; gmake install

0.6 27.11.05
	Looks quite stable. So this is 0.6 :-)

	New features:
	- It's multithreaded. :-)
	- OSX support should be trivial now.
	
0.5pre4 19.8.05

	Work in progress, as usual.
	New features:

	RSSReader:
	- You can select that only articles from the selected feed
	  are displayed.

	RSSKit:
	- Support for the ATOM 1.0 draft, as published by the IETF.
	- Support for Podcasting information (for ATOM 1.0 only ATM :->)
	
0.5pre2 23.7.05
	This is to be considered work-in-progress, although
	it's quite stable

	Most important detail:
	There's a search field now. :-)

	Problems:
	The service doesn't work yet. (Other apps seem to hang
	for some time when trying to access it.)

	Internal stuff:
	Needs newest (0.5pre2) RSSKit, which should come bundled
	with RSSReader.app.

	
0.4 26.3.05
	New icons again (wow, this is going to be
	a running gag ;-))

	This is what I did this time:

	Project has been split into a library (RSSKit)
	and an application (RSSReader). Both can be
	obtained from the RSS Reader homepage at
	http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~guenther/rssreader.html

	The application part has been rewritten from scratch.
	I use Gorm now. Thanks for the Gorm authors for such
	a sophisticated tool. It's impressive how easy it
	really was. :-)

	I almost forgot to mention it: The parser has also
	been rewritten from scratch. RSSKit is free from
	Snownews code. The new parser uses the GSXML class.
	Advantages:

	- Internationalisation works correctly now.
	- We are hopefully independant from libxml2 on OSX
	  when the port is done.

	The application now shows a progress bar when fetching
	the feeds.
	
0.2.3 9.1.05
	New icons (again) ;-)
	
	Some minor bugfixes (Thanks to ratmice and
	rburns for the help!)
	
	Applied a patch by jtregunna, which is a
	general bugfix at many places and is also
	another step towards OSX compatibility.
	Thanks to you, too! :-)
	
0.2.2 19.12.04
	Slightly improved icons by tarzeau,
	some bugfixes in the makefile.

	Added support for the dillo web browser
	
0.2 16.12.04
	First working release.

0.1.2 6.12.04
	Improved some GUI issues when resizing
	windows. Patch commited by ratmice.
