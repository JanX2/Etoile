For DictionaryReader, that's okay with me. As I removed my write =20
access to the SVN, you'll have to change the license on your own, =20
though. I hereby officially allow the members of the Etoile project =20
to relicense my parts of DictionaryReader to the MIT license as =20
stated on http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html . A =20
copy of this e-mail has been sent to the Etoile-Developers mailing list.

For Grr, I'd like to allow you to use the architecture, but I'd like =20
the application to stay free. It's okay with me if you relicense my =20
parts of the files in the top level directory to the MIT license, so =20
that you can use them for your own applications. As for anything in =20
the "Components" subdirectory, please keep this GPL'd. (Grr as a =20
whole will in turn be GPL'd, too, then.) Take care with relicensing =20
files in the top level directory, though! Quite a few of these files =20
include code which I copied from the GPL'd GNUMail.app by Ludovic =20
Marcotte.

Are these licenses okay with you?

As a side note: In case you want to base your own application =20
architecture on Grr's architecture, here are two points you may wish =20
to consider:
	- It's possibly needed on OSX to put the application's core =20
components into a framework, just like GNUMail did. This seems to =20
make including the core headers easier. Maybe Ludovic can provide you =20=

with more information on this.
	- The whole mechanism of passing article sets between components =
is =20
a bit more complicated than it needs to be. If I was to rewrite the =20
application, I'd probably strip it down.

Best regards,
G=FCnther

Sure no problem.

I've recently updated both classes so you might want to get the latest 
version...

Thanks,
