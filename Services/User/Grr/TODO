   Requests, sorted by person
All those are *not* forgotten :-)

 -------
  done:
     * RSSKit/GNUmakefile:
	delete GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT
	* in RSSReader/GNUmakefile, too
     * RSSKit, RSSReader into RSSReader-complete-0.4 instead
	of putting tar.gz into a tar

  half-done:
     * shouldn't there be a service, say (selected text),
	service, rssreader, add feed

  not done:
     * example feeds on homepage for testing
     * icons missfallen, especially '+', '-', 'reload'
	* not so ugly colors, more pale

 erdFerkel
 ---------
   not yet done:
     * Notifications on changed homepages

 Me (guenther)
 -------------
   not yet done:
     * DOAP Support (for freshmeat projects)
     * Support for big blog systems for adding feeds.

 Dirk Olmes
 ----------
   done:
     * Let the user change column width
     * Window: save size (probably NSWindow-setAutosaveFrameName)

   not yet done:
     * Double clicks on feeds should open them in the browser

 Fabien
 ------
   needs to be repeated:
     * Post ANN to discuss
     * GNUmakefile:
	RSSReader_GUI_LIBS = -lRSSKit
        (ProjectCenter doesn't support this)
	* and remove GNUmakefile.p*
     * Crash, if it didn't find browser
     * Name already exists
   
   still need to check:
     * Predefined feeds
     * HP: 'Download latest version now'
     * Does not work with proxies
	* GNUstep bug?
	* ask on discuss
	* also search for GSHTTPPropertyProxyHostKey

 ratmice
 -------
   done:
     * Change icon when new articles arrived
	easy, see NSApplication.h:
	@class NSApplication...
	/*
	 * Setting the application's icon
	 */
	- (void) setApplicationIconImage: (NSImage*)anImage;
	- (NSImage*) applicationIconImage;
     * Minor nitpick:
	in RSSReader/GNUmakefile:
	use $(FND_LIBS) instead of
		-l$(FOUNDATION_LIBRARY_NAME)
