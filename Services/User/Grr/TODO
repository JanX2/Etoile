HTML Parsing
	- (*----) Tags to be implemented:
	      img, pre (needs extra parsing code), code, font, em, ul, ol, li
	
	- (**---) Figure out how to use fonts properly

HTML Display
	- (***--) Images

Looks
	- (***--) Icons:
		* Logo icon:
			* Dog's nose is too big. (Compare with dog photos!)
			* Remove antenna?
		* Missing:
			* Podcast icon
			* 'Add category' toolbar icon, 32x32
			* Generic 'delete' icons for toolbar, 32x32
				* Delete feed : OK
				* Delete category
				* Delete article group

GUI

	- (***--) Check if it's possible to drop articles *on* a database element
	      instead of in between

	- (***--) Attach icons to the cursor when using drag&drop

	- (***--) Make outline view remember the expansion state

	- (****-) Rebuild Fonts preference panel

General
	- (*----) Make databases non-components

	- (****-) Clean up Database code!!!
	      - _One_ method to insert DatabaseElements somewhere
	      - A method to get the best (category, index) tuple for insertion
		
	- (**---) OPML support
	
	- (**---) Find out how the language descriptions on GNUstep work,
	      where the weekday names are read from in the NSCalendarDate
	      initializer method. Make date parsing run with different
	      language settings than just english!
	      [Note: Solved in RSSKit now. When RSSKit is migrated to RSSKit2,
	      this will then have to be done in Grr.]
		
	- (**---) Podcasting support

	- (***--) Enhance component architecture
	      Enhance component architecture so that components can tell
	      the application how important they think they are at the moment,
	      so that the application can switch between Podcast/HTML view
	      itself. (Make this a weak component feature.)

		- (****-) Write ComponentManager class
	
	- (**---) View providing components: Add a method that's called after
	      the view has been placed in a window, so that the components
	      can adjust to the new size. Call this -enableComponent and also
	      add -disableComponent (or similar). Let the table components
	      adjust their tables using NSTableView's -sizeLastColumnToFit
	      method. [NOTE: Is this task really needed or is it overhead?]
	
	- (***--) Podcast Download progress window
	
	- (*----) Improve search component in toolbar
	      Subtask:
		* Find out how to let this search field notify you whenever
		  a letter is entered. (Incremental search)
	      Idea:
		When a letter is entered, a timer is started with a delay of
		a second. If another letter is enteres before the timer rang,
		the timer is reset to a delay of 1 sec. So the timer always
		rings about 1 sec after the last keystroke.
		
		When the timer rings, start a search. If the current search
		string is a refinement of the search string in the last
		search, do a incremental search, otherwise fal√l back to
		basic search.
		
		When the articles to be searched change (by clicking a
		category in the category outline view), try to do an
		incremental search on the added articles when the new
		set is a superset of the original set.
	
	
	- (****-) Proxy class for articles
	      Implement a proxy class for articles that loads the articles
	      only on demand, so that the application startup is faster.
	      This requires modifications in RSSKit. You will have to
	      generalize the code to load feeds from property lists, so
	      that the RSSFactory handles the article loading from the
	      article dictionaries contained in the feed property list
	      structure. The storing code will also have to be adjusted.
	      The resulting code is likely to be incompatible with former
	      versions.

Management
	- (**---) Draw a workflow which TODOs depend on what

	- (***--) Complete Manual Testing documentation
