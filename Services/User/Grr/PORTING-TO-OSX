The OSX port hasn't even begun for versions above 0.4, but
here are some hints what you have to be aware of if you port
Grr to OSX:

1 We don't need the OpenURL.m and OpenURL.h any more. These
  files contain an implementation of openURL: in NSWorkspace,
  which supports web URLs. The original GNUstep implementation
  doesn't support this at the moment.
  
  As a result, the configuration dialog for the web browser
  may be omitted in the OSX version. Although there aren't
  any other things to configure in the preferences at the
  time of this writing, keep in mind that this might change
  in the near future.

2 The interface has to be rebuilt with InterfaceBuilder. I'd
  like to see the 'Feeds' window as a drawer on OSX. :-) On
  the left side of the main window, I want to add a window
  (drawer on OSX?) for managing the filters (which aren't
  implemented yet).

3 Try to keep a source tree which compiles on GNUstep.
