INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

1 - GNUstep

Having GNUstep installed, simply enter 'make' and 'make install'
from the same user account you used to install GNUstep.
Don't forget to '. $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh'.

Versions since 0.6 may have problems installing due to a missing
RSSKit installation. In this case, go to the RSSKit directory,
install this via make install and then compiler Grr.app.

Now, you can run Grr using 'openapp Grr'

2 - MacOS X

Versions below 0.2 of RSSReader were known to work on OSX, at
least parts of the program. Versions above 0.4 are much better
structured and should be easier to port I think. If you have
questions concerning this, feel free to drop me a line; I'll
help you where I can.
