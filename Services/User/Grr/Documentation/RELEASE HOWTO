Release HOWTO
=============

==Before Release

	- Call out feature freeze
	  If you're clever, branch SVN tagging the branch something
	  like Grr-$VERSIONNUMBER-pre.
	
	- Test if interface does everything:
	  See Manual Testing documentation.

	- Test compilation with and without Etoile
		
	- Make sure translations are complete
	  make_strings -L "English German" *.[mh]
	  then investigate Localizable.strings files in *.lproj
	  subdirectories
	
	- Make sure localized Nib files are updated
	  Check if file dates of localized Nib files are newer than
	  reference Nib files
	
	- Make sure the name "Grr" is used throughout the application
	  instead of "Grrr", which is the development version.
	
	- Test localized interfaces by setting NSLanguages default

	- Collect feature list and changes from ChangeLog file and
	  prepare announcements for:
	    - codevelopers
	    - mailing lists
	    - official weblog

==Releasing

	- Clean up directory
	  gmake clean

	- Search for unneccessary files and remove them

	- Create a branch named Grr-$VERSIONNUMBER

	- Create tarballs from SVN, removing all .svn directories

	- If application is already ported to Mac, create .dmg file
	  Refer to Apple documentation on how to do this

	- Put tarballs and dmg to download directory

==After Release
	
	- Announce Release (in this order):
	  - Send mail to all codevelopers
	    Codevelopers are your most valuable help, treat them good!
	  - Send mail to etoile-discuss
	  - Send mail to gnustep-apps
	  - Post announcement on Etoile weblog
	  - Post small note on own weblog
