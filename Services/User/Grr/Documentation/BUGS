BUGS
----

 * Drag&Drop in the outline view on the left is very hard to use.
   This is a GNUstep bug. I submitted a bug report.

 * The HTML parser is very simple and also very instable. At
   the moment, many things can't be parsed with it. When the
   HTML parser fails to display an article, the plain text is
   displayed.
