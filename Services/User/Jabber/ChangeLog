	* RosterWindow.m:
	  Use - outlineView:willDisplayCell:forTableColumn:item: to change cell
	  property and simplify outlineView:objectValueForTableColumn:byItem:,
	  which should just return object to display.
	  GNUstep does not accept NSCell as object to display.
	  The color text does not work yet.
	  Because it is difficult to link NSTableColumn from Gorm,
	  we link it manually in windowDidLoad and set minimal width.
	* English.lproj/RosterWindow.gorm:
	  Update all links from NSOwner.
