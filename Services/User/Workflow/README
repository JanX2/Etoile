Workflow is visual, object-oriented programming language for the purpose of
automating a user/desktop environment. Actually, Workflow is not strictly a
language. It merely generates code from a user made data-flow diagram. The code
generated will be in Io. It will be possible to extend Workflow's functionality
via object bundles (i.e. bundles which describe Io objects, how to create them,
what methods they respond to, etc.). The Io-objc bridge will make it possible to
create object bundles on top of GNUstep and Etoile frameworks.
