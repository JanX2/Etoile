Workflow INSTALL
================

Dependancy
----------

GNUstep-make, -base, -gui, and -back are required (Duh). Otherwise there are no
dependancies for compiling Workflow, however StepTalk and the Etoile Io bundle
will be required in order to run a workflow. Unless changed in settings, a
warning will appear on startup if either StepTalk or the Io bundle cannot be
found.


Compile & install
-----------------

To compile and install execute the following:

  make
  sudo make install

Or, on some non-GNU systems:

  gmake
  sudo gmake install


Run
---

Execute the following in an x11 terminal emulator:

  openapp Workflow

Enjoy!
