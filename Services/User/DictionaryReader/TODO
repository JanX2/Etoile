  that come back when retrieving word definitions. This is to parse:

  The 'code 151 lines' is: "151 " + word + " " + word + " " + word
  where each word is either a string without spaces or a string with
  or without spaces that's surrounded with '"'.
 
* Add a preferences dialog:
	* Let users set their dict server.
	* Let users choose their preferred fonts and colors.
