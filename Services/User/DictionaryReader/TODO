* Extract the dictionary names correctly from the "code 151 messages"
  that come back when retrieving word definitions. This is to parse:

  The 'code 151 lines' is: "151 " + word + " " + word + " " + word
  where each word is either a string without spaces or a string with
  or without spaces that's surrounded with '"'.
 
* Add a preferences dialog:
	* Let users set their dict server.
	* Let users choose their preferred fonts and colors.

* Add a history:
	* Here's an idea on how to do this:
	  Create a history manager object. The HM receives Notifications
	  for each issued query. The HM must also be able to handle more
	  complicated search queries, not only words. (Use dictionaries?)
	  Upon receiving such a notification, it stores the issued query
	  in a stack if the HM didn't issue that query himself. Query types
	  can also be realized via different notification names.
	
	  These notifications can be hooked easily into AppControllers
	  keyword definition methods.

	  When you click back, the HM gets a message and pops the last
	  query from its stack. It then issues a special notification to
	  issue a new keyword definition query.
	
	* Maybe it's better to wait for a OSX compatible history managing kit.
