be clearer, probably by having a single designated initializer in each class 
that must be called by its subclasses.

* preferences dialog:
	* Let users add dict servers.
	* Let users choose their preferred fonts and colors.
	* Allow users to drop their own dictionaries there
	* Redo preferences dialog in Gorm (colors are broken)

* Test if dictionaries disappeared on refresh and startup!
