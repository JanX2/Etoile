* Extract the dictionary names correctly from the "code 150 messages"
  that come back when retrieving word definitions. This is to parse:

  The 'code 150 lines' is: "150 " + word + " " + word + " " + word
  where each word is either a string without spaces or a string with
  or without spaces that's surrounded with '"'.
 
* Add a preferences dialog, so that users can set their dict server
  themselves.
