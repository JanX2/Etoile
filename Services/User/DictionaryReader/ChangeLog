DictionaryReader Changelog
==========================

Jul 6 2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Update nib file and clean up code.

Jun 11 2007  Quentin Mathe
	* DictConnection.m:
	* LocalDictionary.m:
	(-isEqual:): Implemented equality test to avoid adding again a dictionary
	already listed in Preferences window. -[AppController foundDictionary:] 
	checks for identical dictionaries but until now never finds identical ones.
	* DictConnection.h, DictConnection.m (-host): New method.
	* LocalDictionary.h, LocalDictionary.m (-fullName): New method.

Jun 11 2007  Quentin Mathe
	Important update to make DictionaryReader works in a reliable and friendly 
	way. We now look for dictionaries on launching, that means a default 
	dictionary is set by looking for local or remote dictionaries. You don't 
	need anymore to go to Preferences and rescan for dictionaries if no 
	dictionaries.plist file is installed. Fixed crash which occurs when you 
	click two times on Rescan, DictConnection is now properly closed and 
	deallocated. Similar fix for LocalDictionary.
	* AppController.h:
	* AppController.m: 
	(-init): Removed dictionary list loading related code.
	(-awakeFromNib): Added code delagating dictionary list loading to 
	Preferences.
	(-dictionaryStoreFile): Moved to Preferences.
	(-applicationWillTerminate:): Minor update to match previous changes.
	* Preferences.h:
	* Preferences.m:
	(-rescanDictionaries): Extended to call -searchWithDictionaryStoreFile.
	(-dictionaryStoreFile): Added method from AppController.
	(-searchWithDictionaryStoreFile): New method based on code previously
	located in -[AppController init].
	* LocalDictionary.m: Fixed memory management by adding missing -dealloc 
	method.
	(-setDefinitionWriter:): Added assertion to avoid nil argument.
	* DictConnection.m: Fixed memory management.
	(-setDefinitionWriter:): Added assertion to avoid nil argument.
	(-close): Modified to close only if necessary (may help to avoid crash).
	* StreamDefinitionWriter.m:
	* StreamDefinitionReader.m:
	(-dealloc): Replaced RELEASE by DESTROY (not really necessary but extra 
	safety).
	

May 07 2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Change license to MIT as agreed by Günther Noack.
	  Attach email in the end of COPYING.

Mar 18 2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Add missing README

Mar 11 2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Use EtoileUI for UKNibOwner instead of EtoileFoundation.
          Patched by Frédéric Point (Bug #8712).

Feb 19 2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Create ~/GNUstep/Library/DictionaryReader/ if it does not exist.
	* Use host name for property list since NSHost is not a property list.
	* Remove all dictionaries before rescanning.

Feb 12 2007  Guenther Noack
	* AppController.[mh]:
	* */DictionaryReader.gorm, */DictionaryReader.nib:
	* Resources/etoile_[forward|back].tiff:
	Finished Quentin's toolbar code.
	
Feb 11 2007  Guenther Noack
	* AppController.m: Made service method non-blocking
	* DictionaryReaderInfo.plist: "=" keyboard shortcut for service
	* AppController.[mh]: Auto-show the window when the application
	  icon is clicked.

Feb 08 2007  Quentin Mathe
	* AppController.m: Added toolbar code (not yet enabled) to replace the 
	actual top bar. This represents early work to streamline UI in relation 
	to other Etoile applications.

Nov 26 2006  Guenther Noack
	* everywhere: Better assertions, wrote awakeFromNib in preferences
	  controller.
	* UKNibOwner.[mh]: Copied UKNibOwner over to DictionaryReader to make
	  a compilation without Etoile possible. When compiling on Etoile,
	  the application will still be linked to EtoileFoundation instead.

Nov 24 2006  Guenther Noack
	* GNUmakefile: Made the inclusion of etoile.make 'weak' (it doesn't
	  fail any more when it's not present)

Nov 15 2006  Quentin Mathe
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to include etoile.make, this allows the project
	  to compile without installing EtoileFoundation first.

Nov 07 2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* GNUmakefile, Preferences.h: Use EtoileFoundation instead deprecated 
	  EtoileExtension.
	* HistoryManager.m: return self in -init to avoid memory leak.

Oct 15 2006  Guenther Noack
	* Bug #7379 hopefully fixed. Forgot to "svn add" some files... :-/
	* Thanks for the bugreport to YunSong Hwang :-)
	* Commented out the [dict close] line in AppController (that slowed
	  down the lookup times and it's still consistent now)

Oct 9 2006  Guenther Noack
	* Preference panel works now
	* Support for GZipped (.dz extension) dictionaries (GNUstep only!)

Oct ? 2006  Guenther Noack
	* Preference panel for choosing dictionaries
	* Removed my NSString startsWith: helper method in favor of hasPrefix:
	  which already existed. :->

Aug 8 2006 Guenther Noack
	* Local dictionary support written (currently, the jargon file
	  is bundled with the application). Still needs to be made
	  configurable.
	* GUI width increased so avoid automatic line breaks.
	* Edit menu added to GUI (has a 'copy' and a 'select all' entry)

Jun 18 2006 Guenther Noack
	* Fixed the 'bad dictionary names' bug. The dictionary name
	  display in the text view looks much better now. :-)
	  
Jun 18 2006 Guenther Noack
	* Added code which is intended to fix the 'bad dictionary names'
	  bug listed in the TODO list.
	
May 22 2006 Guenther Noack
	* Fixed the bug that made the window stay hidden even when a new
	  lookup was invoked.
	
May 21 2006 Yen-Ju
	* Fix a typo.

May 10 2006 Guenther Noack
	* Applied patch by Chris B. Vetter that provides a Service
	  to look up words with DictionaryReader

Apr 1 2006 Guenther Noack
