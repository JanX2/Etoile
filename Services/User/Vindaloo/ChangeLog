	On the way to streamline Vindaloo UI.
	* DocumentTools.h:
	* DocumentTools.m:
	Rewritten to use NSToolbar.
	* Controller.m (-myAddDocumentTools): Plugged in the new toolbar in place 
	of the old one.

	* GNUmakefile: Udpated to include etoile.make, this should allow 
	Vindaloo to find its PopplerKit dependency within Build directory at
	the root of the repository.
