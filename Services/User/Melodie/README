Melodie README
===================

Melodie is a music player for Etoile.

It is only an early prototype, and not yet useful as a main music player.
However, it is included in Etoile 0.4 because it is currently the best
demonstration of most of the new Etoile components being used together:

CoreObject
EtoileUI
Pragmatic Smalltalk
and also MediaKit and EtoileThread

Known Problems
--------------

- Adding corrupt files will crash Melodie. (Not checking that the tag object returned
by the TagLib C binding is valid. because this function was missing until recent versions)
- Undo and redo are not yet stable.
- UI freezes while starting playback of radio stream
- "Previous" button doesn't work
- Drag and drop not stable

Build and Install
-----------------

Melodie should be built as part of Etoile.

It currently has two dependencies not used elsewhere in Etoile:
- TagLib (C binding), called libtagc in Ubuntu. Used for reading tags of media files.
- libmp4v2. Used for reading tags.

You also need to run the CoreObject database setup script.

If you would like Melodie to start a new library, close the program, and run in a shell:

defaults delete Melodie
