TODO
----

- Fix next/previous controls
- verify gapless song switching. Make sure libavcodec is respecting the lame gapless tag in mp3's
- Finish getting playlists working
- Fix searching
- Last.fm cover art fetching

Eventually:

- Tag writing. Make sure a song can be playing while its tags are changed without problems.
- Last.fm login, reporting songs played.
- Other lastfm features
- CD playback, ripping (Maybe a separate app?)
- Musicbrainz lookup to fix tags of improperly tagged files, or get tags of CD's
- iPod / other portable player support
- (MediaKit) Replaygain support
- format transcoding
