Urgent:

- Get it into a usable state after changing EtoileTunesController to Smalltalk

Soon:

- Fix next/previous controls, gapless song switching
- Finish getting playlists working
- Implement searching
- Last.fm cover art fetching

Eventually:

- Tag writing. Make sure a song can be playing while its tags are changed without problems.
- Last.fm login, reporting songs played.
- Other lastfm features
- CD playback, ripping (Maybe a separate app?)
- Musicbrainz lookup to fix tags of improperly tagged files, or get tags of CD's

- (MediaKit) Replaygain support
