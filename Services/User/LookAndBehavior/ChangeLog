    * GNUmakefile:
    * GNUmakefile.preamble:
    * GNUmakefile.postamble:
    * LanguagesPrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    * AppearancePrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    Fixed compilation by taking in account PreferencesKit has been replaced by 
    PaneKit. Included etoile.make, then removed various variables or rules not 
    needed anymore since they are now handled directly by it. Put PaneKit
    link directive in the shared GNUmakefile.preamble.

    * MainMenu.gorm: Recreated "corrupted" gorm file to have the window title 
    bar displayed. For example, the title bar was invisible with Azalea. This 
    issue is surely related to the perfectible bug fix r453.

    Fixed complete repository scratch build (bug reported by Henri Orlando
    Acevedo Lopez)
    * GNUmakefile.postamble:
    * GNUmakefile.preamble:
    Added (to allow a build without having PreferencesKit deployed).
    * AppearancePrefPane/GNUmakefile: 
    * LanguagesPrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    Updated to take in account new GNUmakefile.preamble.

    * AppearancePrefPane/AppearancePrefPaneInfo.plist: 
    * LanguagesPrefPane/LanguagesPrefPaneInfo.plist:
    Updated to include user friendly titles in the presentation view (where
    panes are listed).

    * MainMenu.gorm: Turned on resize bar option for the main window. Such 
    temporary GNUstep related workaround is mandatory because non resizable
    windows are losing their backend decorations otherwise when Metacity is
    used.

    * AppearancePrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    * LanguagesPrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    Removed xxx_HEADER_FILES because headers haven't to be installed and added
    xxx_STANDARD_INSTALL set to 'no' in order to ignore install phase with
    the related bundles (bug reported by Rob Burns). 

2005-12-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * COPYING: Added.
    * GNUmakefile:
    * GNUmakefile.postamble:
    * AppearancePrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    * LanguagesPrefPane/GNUmakefile:
    Removed verbose license notice not really needed.
    * AppearancePrefPane/AppearancePrefPane.h:
    * AppearancePrefPane/AppearancePrefPane.m:
    * LanguagesPrefPane/LanguagesPrefPane.h:
    * LanguagesPrefPane/LanguagesPrefPane.m:
    Added LGPL header notice.
