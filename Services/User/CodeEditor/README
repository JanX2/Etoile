CodeEditor
==========

CodeEditor is a rewritten version of CodeEditor 0.4.x 
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/codeeditor). 
While it uses the same name, it is completely written from scratch.
It may also borrow from Smultron (http://smultron.sourceforge.net/).
The reason not to port Smultron is because Smultron used classes
which are not available in GNUstep in the near future.
CodeEditor differs from Typewriter is that Typewriter is a rich-text editor
while CodeEditor is a plain-text editor.

It is released under LGPL in case some classes will be used by 
other application or frameworks in the future.

Developer's Note
----------------
CodeEditor does not use built-in document system from GNUstep or Cocoa
because it assumes one document with one or more windows.
But when tab view is involved, many document may be in a single window.
We do not subclass NSDocument and NSDocumentController 
because of the same reason.

CodeEditor treates each document independently. 
There is no "project" concept in CodeEditor.
It may offers to run command or script in the future. 
But it is simply a way to execute commands without switching 
to another application.
