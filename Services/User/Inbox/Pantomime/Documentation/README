Pantomime v1.2.0
===============================================================================


Compiling Pantomime for GNUstep
===============================================================================

To try Pantomime, your first need to install GNUstep. You can get GNUstep at:

http://www.gnustep.org

Be sure to fully read and understand the GNUstep installation procedure. You 
can read a comprehensive guide on how to install GNUstep on Unix systems here:

http://documents.made-it.com/GNUstep/Build/

Once you have installed GNUstep, you can compile Pantomime.

To compile and install it:

cd Pantomime
make
make install

If you are using RedHat 9 or Fedora, you might have to define the 
ADDITIONAL_OBJCFLAGS environment variable, like this:

export ADDITIONAL_OBJCFLAGS="-I/usr/kerberos/include"

in order to include the Kerberos headers during compilation (since
your OpenSSL installation requires them).


Compiling Pantomime for Apple Mac OS X
===============================================================================

In order to compile Pantomime under OS X, you first need to install Apple's
developer tools. You can get them at:

http://developer.apple.com/tools/

Once you've downloaded and installed the developer tools, open Xcode.

Once Xcode is started, open the Pantomime's project file (Pantomime.xcode).

To compile it, choose the "Build" menu item from the "Build" menu. This will create
a "Pantomime.framework" directory inside the Pantomime's build directory. You can
safely move this framework where you want, or simply add it to your application
from Xcode (Project->Add Frameworks...).


Using Pantomime in your application
===============================================================================

Under GNUstep, you must add the following line to your GNUmakefile:

ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS = -lPantomime

Under Apple Mac OS X, you must add the following compiler flag:

-DMACOSX

Otherwise, you'll get errors when compiling your application.
