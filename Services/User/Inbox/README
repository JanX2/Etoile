Inbox
=======

I've wanted to help start the unified messaging sysem for quite a while,
but never produced any code.

So, today I wrote ths simple EtoileUI app, with some model objects that
wrap Pantomime and RSSKit. It seemed like a good first step to ignore
persistency and threading/process seperation for now, and just get something
basic working (but with a nice API - see how simple InboxController.m is :)
