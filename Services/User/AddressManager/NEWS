Current version is 0.4.6.

Since 0.4.5:
============

  o Major bug fixed that caused the program to break with recent CVS
    versions of GNUstep, throwing "GSMutableStrting does not recognize
    count". This came from a broken save routine which would produce
    broken database files. Should work now, and should auto-correct
    errors introduced by the old version.
  o Some other bugs and minor annoyances fixed
  o Spanish localization added thanks to Pablo di Noto
  o Beginnings of LDAP backend added

Since 0.4.4:
============

  o More bugfixes
  o Nicer save format for local address book
  o Re-opens previously selected group/user on startup
  o Made VCF importing more foolproof; semi-silently ignores most
    errors now. I'm not *quite* sure that this is a good thing; it may
    lead to subtle breakage for "experts", but it's certainly better
    than crashing, and it might be argued that if you put garbage in
    you may just as well get garbage out. Thanks to Calvin M. for
    providing me with a broken VCF file.


Since 0.4.3:
============

  o Drag-and-Drop rewritten, unified and much enhanced: People and
    properties can now be dragged from almost anywhere to almost
    everywhere 
  o New Goody: VCFViewer, a GWorkspace inspector for VCF files. Allows
    dragging of people out of VCF files directly into AddressManager
  o View classes cleaned up & delegatizified
  o More bugs fixed

Since 0.4.2:
============

  o Added GWorkspace inspector bundle for VCFs, it's under Goodies.
  o Some more bugs fixed

Since 0.4.1:
============

  o Drag and Drop: ADPersonView accepts Images, VCF files and VCard data
  o VCF files will be opened with AddressManager
  o Localization: Dutch, French
  o Some bugfixes
  o Build structure has changed so the entire tree can be built with
    just a single "make"... no need for the unintuitive "install.sh"
    any more
