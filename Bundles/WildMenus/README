==============================================

Based off Nicolas Roard's excellent Camaelon:

make

defaults write NSGlobalDomain GUIThemeBundles "YourLocation"

(with YourLocation the path to WildMenus.themeEngine, included).

Now, just try to run a GNUstep program ... :-)

Tips:

(20:14:29) MrBIOS-GS: mykull: you should make an addition to that README 
that says you need to blow away your menu location defaults
(20:14:38) MrBIOS-GS: eg 'defaults delete GWorkspace NSMenuLocations'
