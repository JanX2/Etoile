	* renamed the Image class (which poseAs NSImage) in CLImage, to 
	  help reducing conflicts in program. "Image" was obviously too
	  general ;-) -- and Burn.app indeed used an Image class.. 
	  thanks to Rob Burns for the report.

	* All hard coded colors are removed. Colors are now determined by 
	  looking into the "color images" contained in the theme.

	* corrected a problem apparent in Preferences.app. Previously the 
	  drawing was done based on the controlView.. but in Preferences.app 
	  (and possibly other applications), NSButtonCell was used directly, 
	  not just by NSButton. Using the controlView frame was thus causing 
	  rather strange results...  I refactored the code and added a method 
	  drawInRect:on: in CLCompositor to properly handles that
	* corrected a small problem with NSBrowser (the header browser was 
	  always present, because I forced it earlier to test it, and forget 
	  to remove that..)

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* improvements on NSBrowser, Tableview, scrollers, tabview in order 
	  to use the new composition architecture

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	  isn't implemented (and probably depends of the backend)
	* update of NSProgressIndicator to use the new Compositor code correctly

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Redesign of the composition and cache systems, and some cleanup
