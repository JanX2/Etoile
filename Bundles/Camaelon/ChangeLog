        * Make README in reStructured format.

2007-02-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* GNUmakefile: Replaced GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN by 
	ETOILE_CORE_MODULE flag (will be documented and implemented in 
	etoile.make). Also included etoile.make.

2007-01-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* GSDrawFunctions.h:
	* GSDrawFunctions.m:
	(-drawDarkBezel::): Added. This missing method was used by NSBox.m, it
	resulted in a crash on the display of Gorm size inspector.

2006-11-25 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* GSDrawFunctions.h:
	* GSDrawFunctions.m:
	* CamaelonDrawFunctions.h:
	* CamaelonDrawFunctions.m:
	* NSTableView.m:
	Patched to compile (and work) with current gnustep svn. 
	Based on a patch from Matt Rice <ratmice@gmail.com>
	 
2006-09-12 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* NSBrowserCell.m (-highlightColorInView:) 
	(-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:): Added a new method 
	-highlightColorInView: in the 'theme' category. This overrides the 
	method currently used by the class itself and allows to remove a 
	dubious line in the other method. Inspired by an Andreas Hoschler 
	patch.

2006-09-12 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* NSMenuItemCell.m: Applied a patch submitted by Andreas Hoschler that
	corrects a crash on Solaris. Improved the patch a bit to log the error
	since we probably need a better image handling to eliminate such
	potential issue. 
	
2006-05-19 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* CLImage.m: modified the path to properly access the images used by 
	the Windows. Thanks for Chris Vetter perseverance in 
	re-re-re-submitting a patch for it ;-)

2006-03-19 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* committed a patch in NSPopupMenu by matt rice
	* removed GSWindowDecorationView from the makefile

2006-01-18 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * GNUmakefile: Removed superfluous license notice.

2006-01-18 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * COPYING: Relicensed current Camaelon code under LGPL (was previously
    GPLed).

2005-10-28 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	Modified GSDrawFunctions so that all the methods are now instance methods;
	and modified the classes to call them properly (using a THEME macro
	defined in GSDrawFunctions.h).
	GSDrawFunctions holds an instance of a "theme" class (by default, an
	instance of GSDrawFunctions itself) accessible via GSDrawFunctions +theme.
	Themes can be swapped by using the +setTheme: method.
	A new UI "theme engine" (Camaelon for example) thus simply need to be
	loaded by -gui (with the existing GSAppKitUserBundles mechanism), and set
	one of its class as a theme, this class implementing the GSDrawFunctions
	methods.
	That way we should be able to easily:
	- NOT load Camaelon if the indicated pixmap theme is not found :-)
	- SWAP theme on the fly (untested for the moment but should work).
	For the swap on the fly, we will also need a distributed notification to
	ask all the apps to redraw their widgets (registering each NSWindow/NSPanel
	and redrawing from the root should do the work, but I need to implement/test
	it).

2005-07-15 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* NSBox.m : fixed the -drawRect: method to have a correct 
	drawing (with the different borders, and all the possible 
	title positioning)

	* GSDrawFunctions : added +boxBorderHeight and +setGroupBoxImages

	* CLBoxCompositor : added -topHeight/-bottomHeight (useful for NSBox's
	title positioning)

	* CLCompositor.m : removed the previous hack for the NSBox's title..
	
2005-07-14 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* NSColor.m: added the selectedMenuItemColor code, so now the menu
	items use the correct background color when selected. Of course the
	text is still wrong because of gnustep bug #13564 ... more infos on
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=13564

	* NSMenuItemCell.m: added the code to support a different arrow image
	when the menu item is selected.

	* NSComboBoxCell.m: added the file. It's simply to correctly set the
	bezelStyle of the NSButtonCell that NSComboBoxCell uses (shadowless)

2005-07-13 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* GSDrawFunctions.m: added a shadowless button used when the style is
	set to NSShadowlessSquareBezelStyle (and added a style paramater to
	the method too)

2005-07-13 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* CLCompositor.m: added a hack to have a proper title alignment for
	NSBox's titles... will need to fix that properly.

	* Camaelon.m: reverted the part that disabled camaelon when running
	Gorm. Added +initialize to pose CLImage as NSImage and set the
	colorlist via NSColor +setSystemColorList

	* NSColor.m: added a +setSystemColorList method to save colors 
	properly in the system color list -- for some strange reasons 
	it wasn't done, hence the wrong colors in, for example, 
	Gorm's inspectors.

	* NSFormCell.m: the correct (either selectedTextBackgroundColor or
	textBackgroundColor) text's color is set depending on 
	_cell.is_highlighted

	
2005-05-17 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Camaelon.m (-themePath): Added search paths support for theme bundles. 
	  (-init): Added warning for Gorm and theme name extension discarding in order to
	  be more tolerant with user defaults value for 'Theme'.
	* ChangeLog: Formatted in way a bit more compliant with other ChangeLogs.

2005-03-22 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Correction of a bug encounteered by GNUMail with NSTableHeaderCell; basically 
	  the problem is that NSTableHeaderCell was updated and the version used by 
	  Camaelon was too old.

2005-03-22 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Cleaning to remove warnings. (some warnings are inevitable though)

2005-03-22 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Correction of a drawing bug in NSScroller.

2005-03-22 Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* GNUmakefile: Disabled import warnings and updated to look better/identical 
	  compared to other GNUmakefile we use. 

2005-03-17 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Renamed the Image class (which poseAs NSImage) in CLImage, to help reducing 
	  conflicts in program. "Image" was obviously too general ;-) -- and Burn.app 
	  indeed used an Image class. Thanks to Rob Burns for the report.

2005-03-16 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Addition of NSColor +titlebarTextColor and +selectedTitlebarTextColor.
	* Modification of NSWindow drawing code.
	* Tidy up the ChangeLog.

2005-03-16 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Correction of the text displacement in NSButtonCell.m.
	* Cleaning of popup drawing in GSDrawFunctions.
	* Some fixes (added some missing releases).

2005-03-16 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Addition of CLVBoxCompositor for creating vertical compositions
	* Rewrite of NSSliderCell.m, now the sliders use the compositor system and 
	works correctly :-)

2005-03-14 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Correction of a bug in NSOutlineView introduced by the new code.

2005-03-14 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* First modifications in NSBrowser, NSTableView and NSOutlineView to have 
	alternate colors..
	* Correction in GSDrawFunctions of a display problem with NSBox.
	* Addition of test cases in NSBox for the different bezels.
	* Small hack in NSButtonCell to have a correct text placement (-1).
	* Addition of several methods in NSColor to deal with alternate colors.

2005-03-10 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Addition of this ChangeLog :-)

2005-03-10 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* All hard coded colors are removed. Colors are now determined by 
	  looking into the "color images" contained in the theme.

2005-03-10 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Corrected a problem apparent in Preferences.app. Previously the drawing was 
	  done based on the controlView.. but in Preferences.app (and possibly other 
	  applications), NSButtonCell was used directly, not just by NSButton. Using 
	  the controlView frame was thus causing rather strange results...  I 
	  refactored the code and added a method  drawInRect:on: in CLCompositor to 
	  properly handles that.
	* Corrected a small problem with NSBrowser (the header browser was always 
	  present, because I forced it earlier to test it, and forget to remove that).

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Improvements on NSBrowser, Tableview, scrollers, tabview in order to use the 
	  new composition architecture.

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Addition of +readPixelFromImage in GraphicToolbox, as NSReadPixel isn't 
	  implemented (and probably depends of the backend).
	* Update of NSProgressIndicator to use the new Compositor code correctly.

2005-03-09 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Redesign of the composition and cache systems, and some cleanup.
	* Addition of CLCompositor, CLHBoxCompositor, CLBoxCompositor.

2005-03-04 Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

	* Initial Camaelon 2 commit.
