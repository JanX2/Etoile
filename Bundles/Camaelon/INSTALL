Installation
------------

Just compile the Camaelon bundle : 

	make

You should have now a Camaelon.themeEngine bundle. 
Copy this bundle where you want.

After that, you also need to tell GNUstep where to find the 
theme bundle, so write : 

	defaults write NSGlobalDomain  GSAppKitUserBundles '( "YourLocationTo/Camaelon.themeEngine" )'

Then, you need to indicate to Camaelon which pixmap theme you want to use:
	defaults write Camaelon Theme Nesedah

-- here using the theme Nesedah, available on the etoile repository in Themes/

Camaelon looks for themes in ~/GNUstep/Library/Themes/ -- so you will perhaps
need to create this directory if it's not present, before copying your themes inside.

Now, just try to run a GNUstep program ... :-)

Notes
-----

Camaelon usually tracks the state of GNUstep GUI repository; thus if you are
using a version of Camaelon from the etoile repository (or via a svn daily snapshot)
it may not compile if your installed version of gnustep is too old (and by too old,
I mean that even the last public release may be in that category).

Recently (end of 2008, beginning of 2009) GNUstep GUI is undergoing a lot of
modifications related to theming, in order to provide a much cleaner theming support.
Ultimately, this will help simplify a lot Camaelon, but in the meantime Camaelon
could fail to compile from time to time.
