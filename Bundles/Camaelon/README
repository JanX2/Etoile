Introduction
------------
The original look of GNUstep is very close (if not exactly similar) to the NeXTSTEP look. 

While very good when you works with it, it looks a bit old with the current playskool interfaces 
available everywhere ... 
So I wrote this theme bundle, Camaelon, with the idea of providing a fresher look, while 
remaining good in term of useability.

Actually it's not very configurable (you need to change values in the source code for gradients/colors), 
but hopefully it will be the case in a near future ;-)

The other point is to provide a basis for themes under GNUstep; while I did some others attempts
(see http://www.roard.com/screenshots), I'm trying here to not provide for the moment a full theme engine 
but rather a more configurable and enjoyable GNUstep base UI. I'll try in the future to improve this 
theme bundle to effectively provide a full theme engine, but this will involve some works on -gui.

Anyway, I think this current theme bundle is already interessting to test ... :-)

Classic Theme
-------------

This is the current look provided by the theme bundle (theme's name : "Classic").

The differencies are small but forms a refreshing look (buttons/borders, switch and radio buttons, sliders, arrows ...).

The biggest "visual" difference are the gradients (mainly on NSTableView, NSOutlineView and NSBrowser headers).

Installation
------------

see the INSTALL file.

Future goals
------------

- Provide a better configurability :-) -- with a GUI program to easiliy set themes and themes characteristics
