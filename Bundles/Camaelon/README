Introduction
------------
The original look of GNUstep is very close (if not exactly similar) to the NeXTSTEP look. 

While very good when you works with it, it looks a bit old with the current playskool interfaces 
available everywhere ... 
So I wrote this theme bundle, Camaelon, with the idea of providing a fresher look, while 
remaining good in term of useability.

Actually it's not very configurable (you need to change values in the source code for gradients/colors), 
but hopefully it will be the case in a near future ;-)

The other point is to provide a basis for themes under GNUstep; while I did some others attempts
(see http://www.roard.com/screenshots), I'm trying here to not provide for the moment a full theme engine 
but rather a more configurable and enjoyable GNUstep base UI. I'll try in the future to improve this 
theme bundle to effectively provide a full theme engine, but this will involve some works on -gui.

Anyway, I think this current theme bundle is already interessting to test ... :-)

Classic Theme
-------------

This is the current look provided by the theme bundle (theme's name : "Classic").

The differencies are small but forms a refreshing look (buttons/borders, switch and radio buttons, sliders, arrows ...).

The biggest "visual" difference are the gradients (mainly on NSTableView, NSOutlineView and NSBrowser headers).

Installation
------------

Just compile the Camaelon bundle : 

	make

You should have now a Camaelon.themeEngine bundle. 
Copy this bundle where you want.

After that, you also need to tell GNUstep where to find the 
theme bundle, so write : 

	defaults write NSGlobalDomain  GSAppKitUserBundles '( "YourLocationTo/Camaelon.themeEngine" )'

Then, you need to indicate to Camaelon which pixmap theme you want to use:
	defaults write Camaelon Theme Nesedah

-- here using the theme Nesedah, available on the etoile repository in Themes/

Camaelon looks for themes in ~/GNUstep/Library/Themes/ -- so you will perhaps
need to create this directory if it's not present, before copying your themes inside.

Now, just try to run a GNUstep program ... :-)

Future goals
------------

- Provide a better configurability :-) -- with a GUI program to easiliy set themes and themes characteristics
