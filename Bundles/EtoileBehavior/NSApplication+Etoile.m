/* You should not assume anything about the session, since it can be a user 
   session, a project session or even a system session. The only thing sure
   about it is its protocol SCSession.

   First, the session calls -shouldTerminateOnOperation:. Three replies are 
   possible:
   - Cancel
     the session won't call -terminateOnOperation: afterwards and no other 
     feedback will be requested from the application
   - Later
   - Now
     in both cases, the session will call -terminateOnOperation: immediately and
     waits for feedback through -replyToTerminate:info:
   Second, the sessions calls -terminateOnOperation: when it is necessary:. Two
   replies sent aynchronously are now possible:
   - Cancel
   - Now
     in boths cases, they will be sent through -replyToTerminate: which calls
     -replyToTerminate:info: on the session object.
   if -shouldTerminateOnOperation: replied initially NSTerminateLater, this
   means -terminateOnOperation: will need the user interaction, therefore
   will not return immediately; otherwise it should reply asynchronously but 
   without delay either NSTerminateCancel or NSTerminateNow.
