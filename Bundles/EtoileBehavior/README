EtoileBehavior 
==============

EtoileBehavior is registered as an AppKit bundle when you run 
setup.sh script, then it is automatically injected in any 
AppKit-based applications when they are launched. EtoileBehavior 
includes currently the client part of the protocol that makes 
log out possible since GNUstep doesn't include anything by default to do this.
