	* GNUmakefile: Fixed compilation by moving etoile.make include at the
	end. When etoile.make is put at the top, application.make is bizarrely
	ignored.

	* GNUmakefile: Updated to handle XWindowServerKit dependency with the 
	facility provided by etoile.make, this allows to have WorkspaceSwitcher 
	now included in Etoile build process.
