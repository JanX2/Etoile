==========
Etoile 0.1
==========

Etoile intends to be an innovative GNUstep based user environnement built from
the ground up on highly modular and light components with project and document
orientation in mind, in order to allow users to create their own workflow by
reshaping or recombining provided Services (aka Applications), Components etc.
Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow us
to scale from PDA to computer environment.

Various licenses are used, they are specific to each module, but BSD and LGPL
licenses are the most widely used.
