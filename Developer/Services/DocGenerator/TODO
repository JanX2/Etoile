=================

Bugs and Small Features
-----------------------

- Support <override-XXX /> and <init /> GSDoc method attributes
- Expand target method on a method link click
- Support function and perhaps macro links in addition to method links
- Fix autogsdoc to insert no spaces between a method ref and any punctuation that follows. e.g. '-weaveSelector.' and not '-weaveSelector .'
- Ensure '-weaveSelector' is an unbreakable word and won't appear cut by a newline on '-'


Other Features
--------------

- Add Clang-driven doc parser in addition to GSDocParser
