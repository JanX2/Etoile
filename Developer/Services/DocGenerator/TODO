TODO DocGenerator
=================

Bugs and Small Features
-----------------------

- Support <override-XXX /> and <init /> GSDoc method attributes
- Expand target method on a method link click
- Support function and perhaps macro links in addition to method links
- Fix autogsdoc to insert no spaces between a method ref and any punctuation that follows. e.g. '-weaveSelector.' and not '-weaveSelector .'
- Ensure '-weaveSelector' is an unbreakable word and won't appear cut by a newline on '-'
- Wrap examples 
- autogsdoc wrongly generates the paragraph markup when there is a tab on a blank line as below:

	/** @group Weaving and Parsing
	    @abstract A documentation source parser reports parsing result to a weaver through this protocol.
		
	Any weaver must implement this protocol.<br /> 

The related gsdoc ouput is:

	<p>
	  @group Weaving and Parsing @abstract A documentation
	  source parser reports parsing result to a weaver
	  through this protocol. Any weaver must implement
	  this protocol. <br /> When required, [snip].
	</p>


Other Features
