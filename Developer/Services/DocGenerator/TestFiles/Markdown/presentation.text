ETDocGenerator
--------------

ETDocGenerator is a command-line tool that can generates an html page, by
combining an input document and an html template.

Its main use case is to generate the Etoile documentation; it reads
gsdoc files (which are files containing an xml representation of a source
code, generated by the ``autogsdoc`` tool from GNUstep) and generate
an HTML representation of it. This HTML content is then weaved with
different other files:

*  an HTML template (option ``-t``)
*  another file (usually used to include a menu) that is included 
in the template (option ``-m``)
*  a plist file containing a list of classes associated with an url; you
can use up to two files, a main one via the ``-c`` flag, pointing to general
classes (e.g. the etoile framework), and a secondary one containing the classes
in the current project via the ``-p`` flag. This second plist file is also
used for the ``etoile-list-classes`` tag in the template.

Usage
-----

	ETDocGenerator -i <input file> -t <template> -o <output> 
	[-m <menu file>] [-c <class mapping file>] [-p <class mapping file>]

* -i : the input file, which needs to be an html or a gsdoc file
* -o : the output file
* -t : the html template file
* -m : the menu file, if not indicated ETDocGenerator will look for a menu.html
	 in the same directory as the input file
* -c : a file containing an xml plist with a mapping from class names to URL.
	 If indicated, will add links to the mentioned types in the class methods.
* -p : a file containing an xml plist with a mapping from class names to URL.
	 (used for the project classes). If indicated, will add links to the
	 mentioned types in the class methods.

Template tags
-------------

* ``<!-- etoile-header -->`` will insert the generated header from a gsdoc file
* ``<!-- etoile-methods -->`` will insert the methods extracted from a gsdoc file
