DocGenerator INSTALL
====================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use DocGenerator (aka **etdocgen**). The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have the Graphviz libraries and Discount tool installed:

    * libgvc

    * markdown

See <http://www.graphviz.org/> and 
<http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

   * SourceCodeKit, which can be found in Etoile/Languages/SourceCodeKit

These last dependencies are automatically handled when DocGenerator is built by 
running 'make' tool in the root 'Etoile' directory of the current branch.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install


Mac OS X support
----------------

**Warning:** Xcode 4 is required to build the project.

For Mac OS X, you must download and install Graphviz and Discount. 

For installation purpose, [Graphviz website](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php) 
provides a .pkg bundle that can be double-clicked. This should install Graphivz 
in /usr/local, where DocGenerator Xcode project searches for Graphviz headers 
and library.

For Discount, you have to download the source code. First, Xcode command-line 
tools must be installed to get a working Unix toolchain. To do so, go to the 
Downloads tab in the Xcode preferences, then in the Program Components subtab. 
If 'Command-Line Tools' are not installed, click the button 'Install'.

Now launch the Terminal, in the shell go the Discount directory. Now build and 
and install Discount as shown below:

	./configure.sh && make && sudo -E make install

This should install Discount library and tool into /usr/local. For running 
DocGenerator inside Xcode, the 'discount' tool must be installed in 
/usr/local/bin. If the tool is run from the shell, the 'discount' tool directory 
must be in your shell PATH variable.

**Note:** You must also install libclang headers as explained in SourceCodeKit 
INSTALL.
