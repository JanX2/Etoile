DocGenerator INSTALL
====================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use DocGenerator (aka **etdocgen**). The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have the Graphviz libraries and Discount tool installed:

    * libgvc

    * markdown

See <http://www.graphviz.org/> and 
<http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

These last dependencies are automatically handled when DocGenerator is built by 
running 'make' tool in the root 'Etoile' directory of the current branch.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install
