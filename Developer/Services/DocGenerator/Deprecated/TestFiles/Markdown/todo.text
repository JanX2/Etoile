The more obvious problem at the moment is the rather poor cross-linking/replacing. That could easily be improved.
A second problem is the not-so-great parsing of ``desc`` sections (tags...).
It would also be great to modify autogsdoc to somehow recognize markdown syntax (say, if the comment starts with ``/***``).
Even better would be to get rid of the autogsdoc step and use clang to do the parsing ourself.
