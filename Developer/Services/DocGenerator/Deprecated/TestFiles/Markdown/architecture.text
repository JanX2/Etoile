Architecture of ETDocGenerator
------------------------------

The architecture is rather simple; the ``weaveDocument`` function, after checking
the arguments passed at the command line, create a DocumentWeaver instance.

The DocumentWeaver class is the one in charge
with generating the final document; we first indicates the template used,
via the ``loadTemplate:`` method, then create a document using ``createDocumentUsingFile:``.

This method in fact simply checks that the input file has either an HTML or gsdoc extension,
and call the correspoding methods (createDocumentUsingGSDocFile & createDocumentUsingHTMLFile).

Once this is done, the main program set the class mappings if present (still in the DocumentWeaver class),
as well as the menu file, and finally ask DocumentWeaver to write the class.

Document creation & parsing
---------------------------

If the file is a gsdoc file, we create a NSXMLParser instance and a GSDocParserDelegate instance,
and parse it. After the parsing, we ask the delegate for a string representing the methods
(``getMethods`` method) and the header (``getHeader`` method), and then replace the corresponding
tags in the template with those strings. Classes Header, Function and Method are populated by GSDocParserDelegate.

If the file is an html document, the principle is the same, only we directly replace the corresponding
tag in the template with the content of the html document.

Document writing
----------------

The ``writeDocument:`` method of DocumentWeaver is very simple:

	- (void) writeDocument: (NSString*) outputFile
	{
	  [self insertMenu];
	  [self insertClassesLinks];
	  [self insertProjectClassesList];
	  [template writeToFile: outputFile atomically: YES];
	}

We simply insert the menu in the template, then do a pass to add links to any classes mentioned in
the document, then do a final pass to replace the ``etoile-list-classes`` tag, and then write the file.

HTML generation
---------------

While the parsing is a straightforward NSXMLParser delegate, the HTML generation uses the HtmlElement class.
The class is pretty simple, with elements having a name, a set of attributes, and a list of children.
One cool feature is that it uses reflectivity (see the ``methodSignatureForSelector`` and ``forwardInvocation`` methods)
 to automatically call the appropriate method, which let
use write (in my opinion) html in an easier and more readable way:

	  H tdAuthors = TD;
	  for (int i=0; i<[authors count]; i++)
	  {
	    [tdAuthors with: [authors objectAtIndex: i] and: @" "];
	  }
	  H table = [TABLE with: [TR with: [TH with: @"Authors"] and: tdAuthors]
				       and: [TR with: [TH with: @"Declared in:"] and: [TD with: declared]]];

H, TD, TABLE, TR, TH are simple define, e.g:
	#define H HtmlElement*
	#define DIV [HtmlElement elementWithName: @"div"]
	#define TABLE [HtmlElement elementWithName: @"table"]

Yes, it does remind me of the Seaside Canvas.
