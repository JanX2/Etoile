Features
========

- build process support (make test=yes)
- log window for standard output (but without ukrun output)
- hierarchical presentation (probably with NSOutlineView) of unit tests results like
	--> Tests bundles --> Tested classes --> Tests
- search support for unit tests results
- move most of the code in a separate framework to have the possibility to use UnitTests functionality wrapped in a bundle within ProjectCenter etc.
- port to Cocoa
- support of other Unit testing frameworks like OCUnit (not sure but people could be interested)
