Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL document.


Mac OS X support
----------------

Io (GNUstep) is compatible with Cocoa , but you need gnustep-make to build it
since no Xcode project is provided (or will be).


Developer notes
===============

In iovm/GNUmakefile, INSTALL_PREFIX is defined manually.
main.m is copy from tools/main.c with some modification.

Automatically generated files
-----------------------------

These are automatically generated files from Io language:

    * IoVM/IoVMInit.c
    * Vector/IoVectorInit.c (manually generated using io2c in iovm/tools)
    * ObjcBridge/IoObjcBridgeInit.c (manually generated using io2c in iovm/tools)

They are included directly into Io (GNUstep) project, then not in source form 
which would have to be regenerated with each compilation. The source version
for these files can be found in io/ in official Io releases. The tools
necessary to process the source and ouput 'IoVMInit.c' are are located in 
libs/iovm/tools.
