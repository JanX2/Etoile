Io (GNUstep) 0.1 README
=======================

Io (GNUstep) is a module which provides Io language support in a convenient 
way for GNUstep and StepTalk developers or users (linking Objective-C bridge 
by default). 
The module is automatically built in various ready to use solutions:
    * ioobjc (tool you can run in your shell to use Io interactive environment)
    * IoBundle (bundle you can link directly to write Objective-C applications 
      in Io) (Not yet).
    * IoLanguage (StepTalk bundle to script GNUstep applications or interact 
      with them)

This module is released under BSD license (see COPYING document).
Original licence of Io language is BSD License too.

Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL document.


Mac OS X support
----------------

Io (GNUstep) is compatible with Cocoa , but you need gnustep-make to build it
since no Xcode project is provided (or will be).


Developer notes
===============

Dependency
---------

   * StepTalk (Optional): GNUstep languages agnostic scripting framework


Automatically generated files
-----------------------------

These are automatically generated files from Io language:

    * IoVM/IoVMCode.c
    * AAVector/IoAAVectorInit.c
    * IoBindingsInit.c (Move into IoLanguageEngine)

They are included directly into Io (GNUstep) project, then not in source form 
which would have to be regenerated with each compilation. The source version
for these files can be found in vm/_ioCode in official Io releases. The tools
necessary to process the source and ouput 'IoVMCode.c' are are located in 
vm/_tools.
