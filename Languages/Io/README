since no Xcode project is provided (or will be).


Developer notes
===============

Directories structure
---------------------
Due to the reorganization of Io since August, 2006, 
the directories are mapped as:
libs/basekit -> basekit
libs/coroutine -> coroutine
libs/garbagecollector -> garbagecollector
libs/iovm -> iovm
libs/skipdb -> skipdb
addons/Vector -> Vector
addons/Vector/io/Vector.io -> Vector/IoVectorInit.c (manually)
addons/ObjcBridge -> ObjcBridge
tools/source/main.c -> main.m (manually)

In iovm/GNUmakefile, INSTALL_PREFIX is defined manually.

Automatically generated files
-----------------------------

These are automatically generated files from Io language:

    * IoVM/IoVMInit.c
    * Vector/IoVectorInit.c (Need to manually generated)

They are included directly into Io (GNUstep) project, then not in source form 
which would have to be regenerated with each compilation. The source version
for these files can be found in io/ in official Io releases. The tools
necessary to process the source and ouput 'IoVMInit.c' are are located in 
libs/iovm/tools.
