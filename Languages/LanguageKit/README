LanguageKit
===========

LanguageKit provides the abstract syntax tree and compilation framework for
Étoilé Pragmatic Smalltalk and EScript.  LanguageKit is split into three main
components:

- The core LanguageKit framework provides the abstract syntax tree structure
  that front ends (such as Pragmatic Smalltalk) construct and manipulate.  It
  also contains an AST interpreter.
- The Runtime subframework provides a runtime library for code generated by
  LanguageKit.  This sits on top of the Objective-C runtime and provides extra
  features, such as non-local returns and small integers.
- The CodeGen framework uses LLVM to generate optimised native code from
  LanguageKit abstract syntax trees.

Code Generation Overview
------------------------

The code generation framework generates code that is ABI-compatible with
Objective-C.  Classes, methods, and blocks use the same underlying
representation as Objective-C.
