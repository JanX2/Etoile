Differences to traditional Smalltalk environments
-------------------------------------------------

* The OO environment is different to the traditional ST-80 environment.
    
  * Sending messages to nil *always* directly returns nil.
    (XXX: Can it return the 0 integer? How does the automatic type
    conversion handle this?)
    
    Especially the following things do not work:
    * nil == anObject   --> will never work, use anObject == nil instead!
    * nil log.          --> will not log anything. Consider using the
                            ETTranscript instead.

  * In the Objective-C documentation, method names are often written
    differently to the usual Smalltalk conventions:

    Smalltalk	       	   | Objective-C
    -----------------------|-----------------------
    Car>>driveFrom:To:     | -[Car driveFrom:To:]
    Car class>>defaultCar  | +[Car defaultCar]

* The default method return value is nil, not self.

* Basic classes and methods

  * There's a Transcript class called ETTranscript, which has the class
    methods show: and cr.

  * There are no explicit Boolean classes, ifTrue: and the like can
    be called on integers. An integer is considered true iff it's
    not zero.
