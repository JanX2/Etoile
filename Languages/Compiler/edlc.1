.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads, compiles, and executes an OpenStep application written
in Smalltalk.  Either the 
.Fl f
or
.Fl b
options must be specified, indicating a Smalltalk file or bundle to load,
respectively.  Smalltalk bundles may contain resources, lists of frameworks to
load, and may implement GUI applications or command-line tools.  Individual
files may only implement command-line tools unless they handle the creation of
the NSApplication and loading of resources themselves.
