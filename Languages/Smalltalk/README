Pragmatic Smalltalk
====================

This is an implementation of Smalltalk designed to run on top of an Objective-C runtime and 

Status
------

Currently, JIT is working, static compilation is not.

Large parts of Smalltalk don't work.  Methods which accept parameters which are
not objects, instance variables which are not objects, and returns from blocks
are the big things that are broken.  Grep the source code for 'FIXME' and
'TODO' for a clearer picture.

Dependencies
------------

The parser is generated using the Lemon parser generator from SQLite (public domain).
Code generation uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure.
Various parts of EtoileFoundation are used (mainly macros).
These must all be installed to build.
