SourceCodeKit INSTALL
=====================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use SourceCodeKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have the libclang library (along its headers) installed:

    * libclang

See <http://clang.llvm.org/>

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

These last dependency is automatically handled when DocGenerator is built by 
running 'make' tool in the root 'Etoile' directory.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

If the whole Etoile repository is compiled on GNUstep, libclang is usually 
installed, because Etoile depends on LLVM/Clang (as an Objective-C compiler and 
for LanguageKit).

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install


Mac OS X support
----------------

**Warning:** Xcode 4 is required to build the project.

For Mac OS X, you must check out or download LLVM/Clang source code. You don't 
have to compile Clang, but the Xcode project requires libclang headers that are 
are not packaged inside the Xcode application bundle.

For the record, the built-in libclang from Xcode is presently located at: 

<em>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/libclang.dylib</em>

To check out the Clang repository, launch the Terminal, in the shell just do:

	svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang
	cd <path to SourceCodeKit>
	ln -s clang-c <path to Clang repository>/include/clang-c .
	
This should create a local symbolic link pointing to the Clang headers. That's 
all you need to build the SourceCodeKit target.
