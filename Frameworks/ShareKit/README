ShareKit
========

ShareKit is a framework to provide services through zeroconf and http.
It is designed to be used for peer-to-peer communication, mostly, 
data sharing between devices.
SHServer embeds shttpd[1] as a server. 
SHClient use curl[2] to retrive data from server.
Usually SHClient is running in the same application as SHServer.
Then it is necessary to run SHServer in thread (See -startInThread:).

Application registers several paths in SHServer and 
use SHClient to retrive property list based on these paths.
Application will be asked to provide property list based on registered path.

Ideas
-----
With ShareKit, applicationss can provide services as web server.
Clients can use zeroconf to find applications and request data using URI.
By default, each URI will return a property list in XML format (text/xml).
Clients can use standard HTTP/1.1 to retrive large data.
There is no rules about which URIs are provides by applications.
It depends on the design of applications.
