LuceneKit INSTALL
=================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use LuceneKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have zlib library installed:
    
    * zlib
    
See <http://www.zlib.net/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * OgreKit, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation
     PCREParser is also supported as an alternative to OgreKit for regular 
     expressions, see Build and Install.

This last dependency is automatically handled when LuceneKit is built by running
'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make [REGEXP=PCREParser]

   * [sudo [-E]] make install 


By passing REGEXP=PCREParser, LuceneKit will compile and link against PCREParser 
for regular expressions rather than OgreKit.
