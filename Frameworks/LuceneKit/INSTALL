LuceneKit INSTALL
=================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use LuceneKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have zlib library installed:
    
    * zlib 
    
See <http://www.zlib.net/> for further information.

You also need OgreKit, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/OgreKit. This
dependency is automatically handled when LuceneKit is built by running
'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.
