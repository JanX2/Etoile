	* GNUmakefile: Updated to include etoile.make.

2006-07-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/SBServicesBar.h: 
	* Headers/SBServicesBarItem.h:
	* Source/SBServicesBar.h: 
	* Source/SBServicesBarItem.h:
	Moved framework headers and source files in two new directories in 
	order to workaround gnustep-make limitation. ServicesBarMenulet depends
	on the framework itself, but we cannot specify subprojects to be built 
	after the project itself (only before). By moving the framework source
	in a subproject we can control its build order among other subprojects.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Copied, then updated to reference the moved 
	headers as needed.
	* GNUmakefile: 
	* ServicesBarMenulet/GNUmakefile.preamble: 
	Updated.

2006-06-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* GNUmakefile: Fixed compilation by disabling currently non existent 
	StatusItemExample subproject.

2006-06-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	ServicesBarKit should now be partially usable, but it's still uncomplete and
	any remote use outside of the MenuServer is untested. Take note that 
	ServicesBarMenulet bundle has to be copied in MenuServer.app/Resources.
	Major and second part of the MenuServer related update.
	* ServicesBarMenulet/GNUmakefile: Updated.
	* ServicesBarMenulet/ServicesBarMenulet.m: Fixed license to be LGPL and not
	GPL.
	(-init): Updated to handle the whole set up.
	(-publishServerInstance:): Removed.
	(-test): Added a test method the MenuServer will try to call.
	(-displayClickMePanel:): New action method to show a dummy dialog.
	* SBServicesBar.h: Reorganized ivars more clearly, by the way renamed
	properly ivar _itemsToobar to _itemToolbar. Renamed the method
	+sharedServicesBar to +systemServicesBar.
	* SBServicesBar.m: Added a SBServicesBar protocol to be used when the 
	instance is manipulated through a proxy.
	(+serverInstance):
	(+setUpServerInstance:):
	(-toolbar):
	New non public methods. The server instance is now the default shared 
	instance exported by -systemServicesBar: which returns a proxy when called 
	outside of the MenuServer.
	(-insertServicesBarItem:atIndex:): Improved to be more cautious about new 
	items to be inserted, by checking item instance is in the bar instance 
	process and ensuring the item hasn't been already inserted. 
	Updated tests.
	* SBServicesBarItem.h: Reorganized ivars more clearly and replaced 
	-initWithTitle: by +systemServicesBarItemWithTitle:. Added ivar _ownerBar
	referencing the bar instance, therefore the related process where the bar 
	instance is located.
	* SBServicesBarItem.m:  Added a SBServicesBarItem protocol to be used when the 
	instance is manipulated through a proxy.
	(+setUpServicesBarItemWithTitle:):
	(-owner):
	New non public methods.
	(-initWithTitle:): Updated.
	(-description): Added.
	(-setTitle:): Fixed to properly set the related toolbar item label.
	Updated tests.
	* GNUmakefile: Updated.

	Test result (on Linux ppc): 2 classes, 4 methods, 12 tests, 1 failed

    * SBServicesBarItem.m:
    * SBServicesBar.m:
    * GNUmakefile.preamble:
    Fixed test bundle run by adding UnitKit related import directives. Wrapped 
    test methods (or UnitKit related code) into conditional directives, thus this 
    test code is stripped off on normal build.
    Test result (on Linux x86): 2 classes, 4 methods, 10 tests, 0 failed

    * SBServicesBarItem.h:
