 * Thumbnails are stored in ~/GNUstep/Library/Caches/IconKit/Thumbnails.
 * For Freedesktop compatibility, we add ~/.thumbnails soft link to the default
 * path.
 * The directory structure is
 * Thumbnails/normal which contains thumbnails with 128*128 size
 * Thumbnails/large which contains thumbnails with 256*256 size
 * Thumbnails/fail which tracks thumbnails creation errors.
 * Each thumbnail name is a MD5 hash of the original file URL.
 * Delete not valid thumbnails is the job of the user Workspace application.
