IconKit TODO
============


- Finish and test system-wide caching of composited and user-customized icons
- Finish and improve icon compositing facilities
- Write an IconKitExample that demonstrates the main features of IconKit
- Support switching between icon themes without having to relaunch applications
- Make it fast if it proves to be too slow


Additional Ideas
----------------

- Write an application for lively play with the compositing features
- Write an EtoileUI-based icon browser to browse icon themes and eventually 
  control whether they are enabled or not (may be something in the spirit of 
  IconFactory apps)
