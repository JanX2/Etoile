/** Creates and returns a new invocation ready to be invoked by taking in 
	input all mandatory parameters.
	This method is only usable for selector for which the method signature 
	doesn't declare arguments with C-intrisic types. In other words, the method 
	to be invoked has to take only objects in parameter.
	TODO: May be implement support of the C-intrisic types that can be boxed 
	into NSValue instances, by handling the unboxing of the NSValue instances if 
	needed. The code should still work well if the method takes an NSValue 
	object in argument. */
