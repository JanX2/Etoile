/**
 * @group Uniform Type Identifier
 *
 * ETUTI objects represent Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs), strings written
 * in reverse-DNS notation (e.g. "org.etoile.group") which are used to
 * describe data type. UTIs support multiple inheritance to indicate that 
 * certain types are refinements of one or more parent types.
 *
 * The ETUTI implementation also integrates with the Objective-C runtime.
 * UTI's can be automatically generated for a given class,
 * which are given the form "org.etoile-project.objc.class.ClassName".
 *
 * EtoileFoundation provides a built-in UTI library and some class bindings 
 * (UTI supertypes to which ObjC classes conforms to). See UTIDefinitions.plist
 * and ClassBindings.plist in the EtoileFoundation framework resources.
 *
 * Additional UTIs and class bindings can be provided in third-party 
 * applications. At launch time, ETUTI loads any UTIDefinitions.plist and 
 * ClassBindings.plist present in the main bundle and merges the content into 
 * its runtime UTI database. You cannot redefine a UTI built into 
 * EtoileFoundation UTIDefinitions.plist.
