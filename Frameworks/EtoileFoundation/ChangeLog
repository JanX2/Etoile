	* EtoileThread/GNUmakefile: Renamed the framework EtoileThread instead of 
	ETThread. Removed the debug flag -g because gnustep-make passes it by 
	default. Some extra cleaning too.
	* GNUmakefile: Added PACKAGE_NAME declaration and updated to match the new 
	name of EtoileThread framework.

	* GNUmakefile: 
	* Source/GNUmakefile:

	EtoileFoundation and not a standalone subproject as EtoileThread.

	  while Source/GNUmakefile make the subproject

	* Move Cocoa.h to one level up. 
	  I don't see the reason to have it in its own directory.
	* Turn EtoileFoundation into framework.
	* Remove Cocoa.h which I don't know why it is necessary
	  considering AppKit.h should cover everything even on Cocoa.
