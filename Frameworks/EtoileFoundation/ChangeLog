	Set these subframework versions to 0.1.
	* README: Written detailed content.
	* EtoileThread/README:
	* INSTALL: 
	Updated.
	* NEWS:
	* EtoileXML/README:
	Added.

2008-09-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Headers/NSObject+Model.h:
	* NSObject+Model.m: 
	(-primitiveValueForKey:, -setPrimitiveValue:forKey:): Added.
	(-valueForProperty:, -setValue:forProperty:): Updated to use the new 
	methods.
	Also updated these methods in ETProperty class.

2008-09-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Added -hash to ETUUID. The hash function produces around 1 collisions for 
	100000 UUIDs.
	* GNUmakefile: Defined UKTEST_LONG for long testing.
	* Source/ETUUID.m (-hash): Added..
	* Source/TestUUID.m (-testHash): Added a new test for collisions between 
	UUID hashes.

2008-09-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Fixed UUID collisions on Linux by porting FreeBSD srandomdev() to it. If a 
	program is run several times, clock() returns relatively often an identical 
	value and with the low precision: 13000, 17000 etc. for example with ukrun 
	on my machine. This number is used as a seed, so identical sequences of 
	UUIDs can easily happen on Linux. This problem would also occur for multiple 
	programs that run concurrently and create UUIDs.
	* Source/ETUUID.m: Added ETSRandomDev() and modified INITRANDOM to use it if
	srandomdev() isn't available.
	* Source/TestUUID.m (-testString): Added a new test for collisions between 
	random sequences. Turned on collision test by default.

2008-07-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	+allSubclasses and +directSubclasses tested with EtoileUI on Mac OS X.
	* Headers/NSObject+Etoile.h:
	* Source/NSObject+Etoile.m:
	(+allSubclasses, +directSubclasses):
	Fixed this buggy code I wrote yesterday. My loop test was wrong and I wasn't
	taking in account the fact only NSObject root class implements 
	-isSubclassOfClass:, other root classes may not (for example Object).
	(ETGetSuperclass(), ETIsSubclassOfClass()): New private functions working
	as a little abstraction layer over GNU, NeXT 1 and 2 runtimes. Could be made 
	public in future.

2008-07-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Mac OS X backport.

	EtoileCompatibility.h.

2008-07-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

2008-06-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/GNUmakefile: Fixed properly the Linux compilation bug that got

2008-06-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

2008-06-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Source/ETGetOptionsDictionary.m: Fixed compilation on Ubuntu by declaring 
	optopt and optarg. Needs further investigation because getopt() is reported 
	as an implicit function and doesn't seem to appear by default in unistd.h
	as it should. Bug reported by kpropell on etoile-discuss.

2008-06-05  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchenx gmail>

	* UUID:
	  Update to 1.6.1 with Quentin's fix on uuid_dce_to_string (uuid_dce.c)

	to match the previous change.

	  I don't see the reason to have it in its own directory.
	* Turn EtoileFoundation into framework.
	* Remove Cocoa.h which I don't know why it is necessary
	  considering AppKit.h should cover everything even on Cocoa.
