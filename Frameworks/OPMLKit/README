OPMLKit
=======

This framework is a simple parser and exporter for OPML files.
The main classes in this framework are OPMLDocument and OPMLOutline.
OPML is a file format used to store all kinds of outlines. It's based
on XML and also usually stores some meta information. This includes
author and creation time information and a document title. OPML also
allows to store the window position of the outline view. As I think
this is completely unnecessary in most cases, this has not been
implemented. If you need this particular feature, ask me.
