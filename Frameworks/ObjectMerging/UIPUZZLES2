CoreObject 4 Design: UI Puzzles Part 2
======================================

Drag & drop related
	•	Create a document, edit, switch to new branch, drag to shelf. switch back to original branch.
		⁃	the object on the shelf should have a branch menu?
		⁃	the object on the shelf changes back to the original branch when the document is switched back
	•	branching paradox with persistent roots: document (persistent root) is in a folder (persistent root). branch the folder, move the document out, switch back to the original branch.
	•	Drop a hyperlink to a paragraph of doc1 into doc2. Move the paragraph into doc3 (deleting it from doc1). Where does the hyperlink point?
		⁃	to nowhere; moving the paragraph to doc3 created a copy.
	•	Drop a hyperlink to doc1 into doc2. Move doc1 into a different folder. Where does the hyperlink point?
		⁃	

Undo Related
	•	A writing application needs per-document branching and undo. However the documents are contained in a hierarchical project. Also needs stable hyperlinking between documents.


Creating branches, or undoing, on things which contain documents:
	Examples: photo library, music library, document library, entire project
	group of photos, playlist, group of documents, group of drawings / documents

	All of these have the property that a document can be in more than one. I.e. a many-to-many
	relationship with the contained documents. Therefore branching, undo, etc., do not act recursively 	on the contained documents.

Interaction between tagging

Tagging UI semantics
--------------------

-What should happen when you browse the history of a tag/project?
	- just navigates history of which documents are included in the project

Properties of Projects
 - can create/delete without affecting contained objects
 - what are acceptable semantics of revision control of a project?
	- just navigates history of which documents are included in the project
	- navigates history of all documents included in the project + history of which documents are included in the project
		- if (the same) document is in multiple projects, should undo/redo in one project modify another project?
		- probably not.



Project Scenario A
------------------
Eric creates a project to manage research on OODBMSs. He downloads 25 PDF’s and drops them into this project. As he reads them he adds annotations, and groups them in to a hierarchy within the project to keep track of which ones are interesting. He also creates a notes document in the project to keep track of notes. He reshuffles the hierarchy as he works, and altrenates between reading/annotating, taking notes, and reshuffling the hierarchy of PDF’s.

In the middle he switches to the Etoile art project and hunts for fonts/icons.

 -- > Work through

Undo needs to be dynamically for a flexible set of objects (whatever is open/visible on screen right now). Probably the default history view should be this as well.

Should undo in a workspace undo closing a document?
