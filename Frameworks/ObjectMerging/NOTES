"Scalable XML Collaborative Editing with Undo" - Stéphane Martin, Pascal Urso, and Stéphane Weiss
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3615

A recent paper with an approached to editing structured documents with selective
undo.


History navigation
-------------------

Here is a nice paper looking at history navigation in various applications
(windows help, word, netscape, etc)

Undo/Redo
---------

Interesting discussion of undo/redo in Eclipse. 
Looks at different undo contexts (curent text edit view vs workspace)

UI Defaults:
------------
The Undo/Redo/Branch commands should apply to the active document by default.

	Branch Menu
	--------------
 (Default Branch)
    Trying DIfferent Brush    (X = delete)
    New Branch...


Branch Metadata should be mutable.i.e. isOpen controls whether the branch appears on the menus.Design:
The CoreObject store is composed to two halves:
an immutable per-object commit log,
and
a mutable portion which records the current version of each object, defines a 
per-object history track by labeling a tip and current commit.
