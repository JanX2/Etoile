1. Make sure you have sourced the file

      $GNUSTEP_ROOT/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

   You can test this by typing "echo $GNUSTEP_ROOT". If that gives an
   empty line, you need to source the mentioned file.

2. Type 

       make


   This will build everything for you. If you encounter an error
   please send mail to <bjoern@giesler.de>. (Warnings are sort of OK
   :-))

3. As root, type

      make install

4. As a normal user again, type

      openapp AddressManager

Bingo!

There are a couple of things in the subdirectory Goodies, which for
some reason aren't built by default. You can build all of them in
precisely the same way (make, make install), or you can just type
"make goodies" followed by "make goodies-install" in the main
directory. Look at Goodies/README for details.
