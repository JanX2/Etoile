Addresses Goodies
=================

This directory contains a couple of things that might be of use:

o VCFInspector

  A content inspector bundle for GWorkspace. Since I can't be sure
  that everybody has GWorkspace installed, and this needs GWorkspace
  headers, it's not built by default. It's horribly useful
  nonetheless. You can use it to browse through VCFs and also to drag
  single addresses out of VCFs into the address book, terminal, any
  text field, ...

o adgnumailconverter

  A tool that will merge your GNUMail address book into the Addresses
  database.

o adserver

  A stand-alone Addresses network server.

o adtool

  A command-line tool for address database manipulation

o LDAPAddressBook

  An address book plugin to handle LDAP connections. Needs GSLDAP!

Each of these can be built by cd'ing into the respective directory, or
you can build and install them all at once simply by typing "make; make
install" in the Goodies directory.
