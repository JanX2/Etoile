OrganizeKit provides a common storage facility for objects with properties,
such as contact information, playlist, bookmark, etc.
These objects have defined structure (property-value relationship) 
which can be handled better than general property list.
But values of these properties are too flexible to be stored in database,
for example, a contact information may have multipe home phone numbers.
Records can be grouped and groups can have groups inside.
AddressBook framework from Apple provides a good machenism of handling 
these kind of objects.  OrganizeKit aims to provide a general storage 
facility based on similar interface.

It also includes a subset of Blocks framework[1] to build applications
in plugin architecture.

Note: OrganizeKit is written from scratch. 
It only try to mimic the API of AddressBook.
It is supposedly to be the next version of CollectionKit.

Developer
---------

* OrganizeKit provides three basic unit:
  OKObject, OKGroup and OKCollection.

* OKObject is the basic unit with arbitrary property.
  It provides -setValue:forKey: and -valueForKey:. 
  Besides basic data type provided by GNUstep, OKMultiValue is allowed.

* OKGroup is a subclass of OKObject and can contain objects or subgroups.
  It has a hierarchical structure where any object must belong to one
  or more groups (subgroups).

* OKCollection can contain objects and groups.
  Objects may not belong to any group.

* Search is handled with NSPredicate instead of something simliar to 
  ABSearchElement to reduce redundancy.

* Each item has a unique ID (UUID) in the collection.
  It is generated automatically and should not change
  unless collision is avoid.

* Each unit provide property list to be stored.
