/**
 * @group History Interaction
 *
 * An undo track represents a history track that can record commits selectively. 
 *
 * For a commit done in an editing context, an undo track can be passed using 
 * â€“[COEditingContext commitWithIdentifier:undoStack:]. When the commit is saved, 
 * the editing context records the commit as a command using -recordCommand:.
 * At this point, the undo track saves the command on disk.
 *
 * Commits that contain object graph context changes result in new revisions in 
 * the store. For other commits that just contain store structure changes:
 *
 * <list>
 * <item>branch creation</item>
 * <item>branch deletion</item>
 * <item>branch undeletion</item>
 * <item>branch switch</item>
 * <item>branch revision change</item>
 * <item>branch metadata editing (e.g. branch renaming)</item>
 * <item>persistent root creation</item>
 * <item>persistent root deletion</item>
 * <item>persistent root undeletion</item>
 * </list>
 *
 * no new revisions is created. The store doesn't record them in any way.
 *
 * However an undo track can track both: 
 * 
 * <list>
 * <item>store structure history (represented as custom commands e.g. COCommandDeleteBranch etc.)
 * <item>branch history (represented as COCommandNewRevisionForBranch)
 * </list>
 *
 * undo tracks can track all these changes or a subset per application or per 
 * use cases, and provide undo/redo support. For undo/redo menu actions, never 
 * manipulate the branch history directly, but use an undo track.
 *
 * You can navigate the command sequence to change the editing context state 
 * using -undo, -redo and -setCurrentNode:. COUndoStack supports the same 
 * history navigation protocol than COBranch.
