	Fixed file move operation and probably copy too (have to write tests to 
	ensure copy works as advertised).

	(-addObject:, -addSymbolicLink:, -addHardLink:, 
	-checkObjectToBeRemovedOrDeleted:): Corrected object validity boolean test.
	(-addCopiedObject, -addMovedObject:): Fixed destination path to match 
	NSFileManager expectation.

	Introduced a preliminary CoreObject protocol and a filesystem backend that
	implements it.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	Added a rough CoreObject protocol that consists of COObject and COGroup

	* Headers/COFile.h:
	* COFile.m:.
	* Headers/CODirectory.h:
	* CODirectory.m:.

	Added.
	* GNUmakefile:
	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
