	Introduced a preliminary CoreObject protocol and a filesystem backend that
	implements it.
	* Headers/COObject.h:
	* Headers/COGroup.h:
	Added a rough CoreObject protocol that consists of COObject and COGroup
	protocols. COObject and COGroup classes don't yet conform to these.
	* Headers/COFile.h:
	* COFile.m:.
	* Headers/CODirectory.h:
	* CODirectory.m:.

	out of the framework into a standalone bundle.
	* TestFile.m:
	* TestDirectory.m:
	Added.
	* GNUmakefile:
	* Headers/CoreObject.h:
