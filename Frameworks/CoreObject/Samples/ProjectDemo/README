This is an attempt to write a demonstration of a project UI with all of the
neat things we want:

 - revision control / checkpointing / branching / merging / selective undo
 - collaborative editing

It uses my CoreObject rewrite as its persistence layer.

The library is saved in ~/ProjectDemoStore

What's working:

 - creating / editing outline documents
 - commiting changes
 - making checkpoints
 - restoring to a previous revision (altough the implementation is flawed and needs to be redone)
 - chat with other ProjectDemo instances running on the local network
 
What's not yet working:

 - other document types (drawing, text)
 - no way to delete a document once it's created
 - saving document positions on the screen
 - collaborative editing
 - selective undo
 - normal undo/redo
 - ...
