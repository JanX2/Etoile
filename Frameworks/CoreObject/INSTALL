==================
CoreObject INSTALL
==================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use CoreObject. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have PostgreSQL and libpq library installed:

    * PostgreSQL

    * libpq

See <http://www.postgresql.org/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

   * EtoileSerialize, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileSerialize

These last two dependencies are automatically handled when CoreObject is built 
by running 'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.
