	Fixed compile error submitted by YunSong Hwang (Thank you!)

	For everybody who knows the RSSKit code, here are the changes I
	did in restructuring:

	In the old version anything related to parsing was in the
	RSSFeed+Fetching category. The file for this category also
	included the class RSSArticleCreationListener which accepts
	the different article components (Title, Content, Links etc.)
	and puts them together after that. When the parser (in RSSFeed)
	told the instance of RSSArticleCreationListener to '-finish',
	it submitted the collected articles back to the feed.

	The new version is more taken apart now:
	* RSSArticleCreationListener now has its own .m and .h files.
	  The class was also renamed to RSSArticleConstructor to avoid
	  naming confusion with the planned protocol that accepts newly
	  created articles from it.
	* The parsers are now located in their own classes. Here's the
	  class hierarchy:
	  
	  - RSSArticleConstructor
	    - FeedParser
	      - AtomParser
	        - Atom03Parser
		- Atom10Parser
	      - RSS10Parser
	      - RSS20Parser
	  
	  Note that the feed parser classes inherit from the Article-
	  Constructor, so that they don't have to do an extra instantiation
	  for it. (There was a 1:1 relation between the parser and the
	  constructor anyway.)

	* I started to build classes for the different RSS types. Should
	  have done that long ago; RSSFeed+Fetching just got much too big. ;-)

	  Besides the size of the 'Fetching' category file, I also want to
	  decouple the existence of a RSSFeed object from the ability to
	  parse RSS files. In the long run, the RSSFeed class will play a
	  minor role in the Grr application, too.

	  Sidenote: This version is completely b0rken! It may compile
	  but will not parse any feeds.

	* Tests run now. I built tests for RDF (RSS 1.0) files. Others
	  still need to be built. It's a pity that the UnitKit GUI's Nib
	  is b0rken. :-/
	
May-26-2006 Yen-Ju Chen
	* Fix Tests.

Mar-30-2006 Guenther Noack
	* RSSFeed: Added a delegate to the RSSFeed. (Completely untested)
	  The delegate will be notified for every new article that has been
	  added to the feed. This may be useful for more easy coding of
	  small applications (e.g. AppCasting stuff)
	
Mar-18-2006 Guenther Noack
	* FeedFetching.* renamed to RSSFeed+Fetching.*
	* Added RSS2.0 enclosure support (a.k.a. Podcasts).

Mar-14-2006 Yen-Ju Chen <yjchen at gmail>
        * GNUstep.h: New
        Make it compile on mac and fix some compilation warnings..

Jan-16-2006
	Version 0.6.1-2

	Got ATOM working again. Needed to restructure and extend the DOM
	classes a bit. Implementing HTML parsing with it should be trivial
	to do now. :-)
	
Nov-27-2005
	Stable release 0.6

	Main 'feature' added:
	- Finally threw away the last code using the GSXML* classes,
	  so now it uses NSSAXParser and is thum *fully OSX compatible* :-)

Aug-19-2005
	Another Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre4
	
	- Support for the ATOM 1.0 draft, as published by the IETF.
	- Support for Podcasting information (for ATOM 1.0 only ATM :->)

	If you want to use the podcasting features, call 'links' on an
	RSSArticle. This returns an array of NSURL objects. Call 
	propertyForKey:@"type" and propertyForKey:@"rel" on those to
	get additional information to the URL. (This is a nightly hack,
	still not tested.)
	
Jul-23-2005
	Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre2
	interface mostly compatible to old releases.
	
	The 'dirty' flag is deprecated, we now save the date of
	the last retrieval.
	
	You can supply a feed with a class type which should be used
	to create new RSSArticle objects. This must be derivated from
	RSSArticle.
	
Apr-12-2005
	Initial release
	Version 0.4
	only small bugfixes

Mar-26-2005
