Jan-16-2006
	Version 0.6.1-2

	Got ATOM working again. Needed to restructure and extend the DOM
	classes a bit. Implementing HTML parsing with it should be trivial
	to do now. :-)
	
Nov-27-2005
	Stable release 0.6

	Main 'feature' added:
	- Finally threw away the last code using the GSXML* classes,
	  so now it uses NSSAXParser and is thum *fully OSX compatible* :-)

Aug-19-2005
	Another Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre4
	
	- Support for the ATOM 1.0 draft, as published by the IETF.
	- Support for Podcasting information (for ATOM 1.0 only ATM :->)

	If you want to use the podcasting features, call 'links' on an
	RSSArticle. This returns an array of NSURL objects. Call 
	propertyForKey:@"type" and propertyForKey:@"rel" on those to
	get additional information to the URL. (This is a nightly hack,
	still not tested.)
	
Jul-23-2005
	Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre2
	interface mostly compatible to old releases.
	
	The 'dirty' flag is deprecated, we now save the date of
	the last retrieval.
	
	You can supply a feed with a class type which should be used
	to create new RSSArticle objects. This must be derivated from
	RSSArticle.
