	* RSSFeed: Added a delegate to the RSSFeed. (Completely untested)
	  The delegate will be notified for every new article that has been
	  added to the feed. This may be useful for more easy coding of
	  small applications (e.g. AppCasting stuff)

Jan-16-2006
	Version 0.6.1-2

	Got ATOM working again. Needed to restructure and extend the DOM
	classes a bit. Implementing HTML parsing with it should be trivial
	to do now. :-)
	
Nov-27-2005
	Stable release 0.6

	Main 'feature' added:
	- Finally threw away the last code using the GSXML* classes,
	  so now it uses NSSAXParser and is thum *fully OSX compatible* :-)

Aug-19-2005
	Another Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre4
	
	- Support for the ATOM 1.0 draft, as published by the IETF.
	- Support for Podcasting information (for ATOM 1.0 only ATM :->)

	If you want to use the podcasting features, call 'links' on an
	RSSArticle. This returns an array of NSURL objects. Call 
	propertyForKey:@"type" and propertyForKey:@"rel" on those to
	get additional information to the URL. (This is a nightly hack,
	still not tested.)
	
Jul-23-2005
	Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre2
	interface mostly compatible to old releases.
	
	The 'dirty' flag is deprecated, we now save the date of
	the last retrieval.
	
	You can supply a feed with a class type which should be used
	to create new RSSArticle objects. This must be derivated from
	RSSArticle.
