	* Turn into framework

Feb-19-2007  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Format README in reStructuedText

Feb-17-2007  Guenther Noack
	* RSSArticleCreationListener.m:
	  Parse english dates, even in other locales

Feb-12-2007  Guenther Noack
	* RSSFeed.m:
	* RSSFeed+Storage.m:
	* RSSArticle.m:
	  Memory leaks fixed

Jan-30-2007  Guenther Noack
	* RSSFeed.m: Fixed bug that feeds couldn't be compared for equality
	  with non-feed objects.

Jan-21-2007  Guenther Noack
	* RSSFeed+Fetching.m: Fixed bug where freshly created articles
	  didn't know their parent feed.
	* FeedParser.m: Updated a FIXME

Jan-13-2007  Guenther Noack
	* INTRO: Added a small note concerning the way how to obtain the
          Grr development version as a programming example for RSSKit.

Dec-6-2006  Guenther Noack
	* ATOM 0.3, 1.0: Accept text/plain and text/html as types, too

Nov-27-2006  Guenther Noack
	* DOMParser: CDATA support added
	* RSSArticleCreationListener: more date formats added
	* ChangeLog file: Cleaned up a bit (added my name to old
	  entries where I was the only contributor)
	* GNUmakefile: Made the etoile.make include 'weak' (presence
	  of it is no longer required in order to compile)

Nov-26-2006  Guenther Noack
	* RSSArticle: -description method now returns the headline. Please
	  use the -content method to retrieve the article content now. This
	  breaks compatibility with old Grr versions but makes more sense.
	* RSSFeed delegate: Removed (not used by Mollusk nor Grr)
	* RSSFeed: performance improvements when autoclear is off
	* RSSFeed protocol: Added autoclear accessor methods

Nov-12-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Process namespace for XMLParser.
          It is essential for atom 1.0.
	* Avoid add nil RSSLink into array.

Nov-11-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Fixed namespace bug (namespaces were accidentally ignored before)
	* Improved date parsing

Nov-11-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
        * Try to fix random failed fetching issue by more safe guard.

Nov-10-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Try to improve memory usage by properly retain and release.

Nov-09-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Removed some deprecated methods from RSSFeed class
	* Added -articleSet and -articleCount method to RSSFeed
	  protocol and class
	* Added support for some more itunes-Namespace (=Podcast)
	  features. (Why doesn't the namespace work any more?)

Nov-08-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Fixed enclosure-link bug

Nov-06-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Compile on Cocoa.
	* Post notification if fatching failed.

Nov-05-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Removed some deprecated methods
	* Dropped NSCoding serialization methods (not used by anyone
	  at the moment and they were broken anyway since the intro-
	  duction of the RSSLink class). Please use the methods in
	  the Storage categories instead. 
	* Added Factory class

Nov-04-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Removed lock from RSSFeed class. (The lock is left from
	  a first try with multithreading and never really did what
	  it was supposed to do.)
	* Put RSSFeed and RSSArticle protocols in seperate files.

Nov-03-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Compile on Cocoa.

Nov-03-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Protocols (interfaces) for RSSFeed and RSSArticle
	* Fixed RSSFeed storage, so that restored articles have the
	  correct parent feed.
	* Deprecated -status method in feed in favor of -isFetching,
	  which is much more suitable for a boolean return value. (There
	  was only RSSFeedIsFetching and RSSFeedIsIdle.)

	* Fixed creation of articles without proper 'alternate' link.

Oct-30-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Fixed URL loading bug for the storage

	  replace NSURL for the storage of links from articles.	

Oct-29-2006  Yen-Ju Chen

Oct-25-2006  Yen-Ju Chen

	* Merge back from branch.

Sep-25-2006  Guenther Noack
	Relicensed to LGPL

Jul-7-2006 to Jul-11-2006  Guenther Noack
	Fixed compile error submitted by YunSong Hwang (Thank you!)

	For everybody who knows the RSSKit code, here are the changes I
	did in restructuring:

	In the old version anything related to parsing was in the
	RSSFeed+Fetching category. The file for this category also
	included the class RSSArticleCreationListener which accepts
	the different article components (Title, Content, Links etc.)
	and puts them together after that. When the parser (in RSSFeed)
	told the instance of RSSArticleCreationListener to '-finish',
	it submitted the collected articles back to the feed.

	The new version is more taken apart now:
	* RSSArticleCreationListener now has its own .m and .h files.
	  The class was also renamed to RSSArticleConstructor to avoid
	  naming confusion with the planned protocol that accepts newly
	  created articles from it.
	* The parsers are now located in their own classes. Here's the
	  class hierarchy:
	  
	  - RSSArticleConstructor
	    - FeedParser
	      - AtomParser
	        - Atom03Parser
		- Atom10Parser
	      - RSS10Parser
	      - RSS20Parser
	  
	  Note that the feed parser classes inherit from the Article-
	  Constructor, so that they don't have to do an extra instantiation
	  for it. (There was a 1:1 relation between the parser and the
	  constructor anyway.)  
	  

Jun-30-2006  Guenther Noack
	* I started to build classes for the different RSS types. Should
	  have done that long ago; RSSFeed+Fetching just got much too big. ;-)

	  Besides the size of the 'Fetching' category file, I also want to
	  decouple the existence of a RSSFeed object from the ability to
	  parse RSS files. In the long run, the RSSFeed class will play a
	  minor role in the Grr application, too.

	  Sidenote: This version is completely b0rken! It may compile
	  but will not parse any feeds.
	
May-26-2006  Guenther Noack
	* Tests run now. I built tests for RDF (RSS 1.0) files. Others
	  still need to be built. It's a pity that the UnitKit GUI's Nib
	  is b0rken. :-/
	
May-26-2006  Yen-Ju Chen
	* Fix Tests.

Mar-30-2006  Guenther Noack
	* RSSFeed: Added a delegate to the RSSFeed. (Completely untested)
	  The delegate will be notified for every new article that has been
	  added to the feed. This may be useful for more easy coding of
	  small applications (e.g. AppCasting stuff)
	
Mar-18-2006  Guenther Noack
	* FeedFetching.* renamed to RSSFeed+Fetching.*
	* Added RSS2.0 enclosure support (a.k.a. Podcasts).

Mar-14-2006  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchen at gmail>
        * GNUstep.h: New
        Make it compile on mac and fix some compilation warnings..

Jan-16-2006  Guenther Noack
	Version 0.6.1-2

	Got ATOM working again. Needed to restructure and extend the DOM
	classes a bit. Implementing HTML parsing with it should be trivial
	to do now. :-)
	
Nov-27-2005  Guenther Noack
	Stable release 0.6

	Main 'feature' added:
	- Finally threw away the last code using the GSXML* classes,
	  so now it uses NSSAXParser and is thum *fully OSX compatible* :-)

Aug-19-2005  Guenther Noack
	Another Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre4
	
	- Support for the ATOM 1.0 draft, as published by the IETF.
	- Support for Podcasting information (for ATOM 1.0 only ATM :->)

	If you want to use the podcasting features, call 'links' on an
	RSSArticle. This returns an array of NSURL objects. Call 
	propertyForKey:@"type" and propertyForKey:@"rel" on those to
	get additional information to the URL. (This is a nightly hack,
	still not tested.)
	
Jul-23-2005  Guenther Noack
	Pre-Release
	Version 0.5pre2
	interface mostly compatible to old releases.
	
	The 'dirty' flag is deprecated, we now save the date of
	the last retrieval.
	
	You can supply a feed with a class type which should be used
	to create new RSSArticle objects. This must be derivated from
	RSSArticle.
	
Apr-12-2005  Guenther Noack
	Initial release
	Version 0.4
	only small bugfixes

Mar-26-2005  Guenther Noack
	Preview release
	Version, umm, 0.1
