Sorry, this was so completely deprecated that I figured out deleting
it is a better idea. Here's how to understand RSSKit:

Read the RSSArticleProtocol.h, RSSFeedProtocol.h, RSSFactory.h files.
They will give you a hint on how to use RSSKit. You can write your own
concrete factory to make use of RSSArticle subclassing easier.

Look at the Grr development version Grrr for an example on how to do
this. It will be available in the Etoile SVN by the end of February
2007. Until then, just write me a mail: guenther@unix-ag.uni-kl.de
