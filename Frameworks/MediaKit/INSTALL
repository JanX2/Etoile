MediaKit INSTALL
================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile and 
use MediaKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

You also need to have the following FFmpeg libraries and Open Sound System 
support installed:

    * libavcodec and libavformat

    * oss

See <http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/> and <http://www.opensound.com/> for further 
information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileFoundation, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation

   * SystemConfig, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/SystemConfig

These last dependencies are automatically handled when MediaKit is built by 
running 'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install
