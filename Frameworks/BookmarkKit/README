BookmarkKit 
===========

It provides a basic storage for shared bookmarks.
It can be used for web browser bookmark, recently opened documents, etc.
It is based on CollectionKit.

BookmarkKit has a basic assumption: it has a hierarchical structure.
A bookmark or a group can only exist under a group.
In another word, an item or a group can has a parent or none.
Therefore, bookmark can be displayed in NSOutlineView.
