BookmarkKit 
-----------

It provides a basic storage for shared bookmarks.
It can be used for web browser bookmark, recently opened documents, etc.
It is based on CollectionKit.

BookmarkKit has a basic assumption: it has a hierarchical structure.
In another word, a bookmark or a group can only exist under a group.
Therefore, bookmark can be displayed in NSOutlineView.
