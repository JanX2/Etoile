:Version: 1.0.1

PopplerKit is a GNUstep/Cocoa framework for accessing and rendering 
PDF content. It is based on the `poppler library <http://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`_ 
which itself based on the `xpdf <http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/>`_ codebase.

Features:

- Render PDF content.
- Extract text from a PDF document.
- Access a PDF document's outline.
- Search in PDF documents.

*Note that not all features are implemented by now.*

This is an Etoile fork of PopplerKit 1.0 from GNUstep Image Apps project  
<http://home.gna.org/gsimageapps/>. GNUstep Image Apps has been on hold for 
two years, the Etoile version of PopplerKit mostly consists of bug fixes not 
present in the original version.

Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL document.


Mac OS X support
----------------

The current Xcode project has not been tested for a while and is quite old.
Building from source is a little bit tricky since you need to build the required 
libraries first. There are scripts to do this inside the 3rdParty directory but 
the process is not well documented at the moment.


Developer notes
===============

For now, the development of PopplerKit is closely connected to development of 
the [Vindaloo PDF Reader](http://home.gna.org/gsimageapps/vindaloo). With more 
features beeing added to Vindaloo, PopplerKit will become more stable and 
completed. At some point, possibly when there are more users of PopplerKit, it 
will get it's own "roadmap".

The primary goal is to make PopplerKit stable and usable first. More features 
and improvements will be added then.
