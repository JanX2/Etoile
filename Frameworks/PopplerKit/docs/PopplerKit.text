# PopplerKit

PopplerKit is a GNUstep/Cocoa framework for accessing and rendering PDF content. It is based on the [poppler library](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) which itself based on the [xpdf](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) codebase.

## Features

- Render PDF content.
- Extract text from a PDF document.
- Access a PDF document's outline.
- Search in PDF documents.

*Note that not all features are implemented by now.*
 
## Development

For now, the development of PopplerKit is closely connected to development of the [Vindaloo PDF Reader](http://home.gna.org/gsimageapps/vindaloo). With more features beeing added to Vindaloo, PopplerKit will become more stable and completed. At some point, possibly when there are more users of PopplerKit, it will get it's own "roadmap".

The primary goal is to make PopplerKit stable and usable first. More features and improvements will be added then.

## Getting PopplerKit

PopplerKit can be downloaded from the [download section](http://download.gna.org/gsimageapps/PopplerKit) at the project home on gna.org.

### GNUstep
For GNUstep, you have to download the source distribution and build PopplerKit from source. You definitly need an installed version of the poppler library (cairo support is optional). PopplerKit has been tested with poppler 0.3.3. It is *strongly* recommend to read the Installation instructions for further informations.

### Mac OS X
For Mac OS X I strongly recommend to get the prebuild Framework. Building from source is a little bit tricky since you need to build the required libraries first. There are scripts to do this inside the 3rdParty directory of the source distribution but the process is not well documented at the moment. The prebuild Framework has been statically linked against all required libraries (poppler, cairo, freetype, ...) so there are no other dependencies.
