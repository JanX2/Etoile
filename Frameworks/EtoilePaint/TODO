TODO
====

 - Continue the brush implementation which is currently very primitive

 - Figure out how to have filters in EtoileUI which cause part of the layout
   item tree to be rendered to a bitmap so the filter (e.g. blur) can be
   applied.

 - Come up with a better name :)
   Maybe an artist's name, an artistic technique, or a flower name
