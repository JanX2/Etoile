EtoilePaint is a set of extensions to EtoileUI to provide artist's tools.

The goal is to provide both tools traditionally found in bitmap editors, and
those found in vector editors, and build on EtoileUI's pluggable style system
to give the artist great flexibility. For example:

 - it should be possible to change the style of part of a sketch after it is
   drawn

 - it should be possible add filters (blur, sharpen, levels/curves adjustment,
   etc.) to any part of the layout item tree at any time, or tweak the 
   paramaters of one of these filters.
