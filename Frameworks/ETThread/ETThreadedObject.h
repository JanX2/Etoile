 * The ETThreadedObject class represents an object which has its

 * or void will, when sent to this object, return asynchronously.
 *
 * For methods returning an object, an [ETThreadProxyReturn] will
 * be returned immediately.  Messages passed to this object will
 * block until the real return value is ready.
 *
 * In general, methods in this class should not be called directly.
 * Instead, the [NSObject(Threaded)+threadedNew] method should be 
 * used.
