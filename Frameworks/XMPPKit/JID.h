 * The JID class represents a Jabber ID of the form user@server/resource.  A JID
 * may have all three components, a user and a server but no resource, a server
 * and resource but no user, or just a server.
 *
 * Typically, two JIDs are referring to the same person (but not the same 
 * client) when they have the same user and server.  For this reason, it is 
 * possible to compare two JIDs either with or without their associated 
 * resources.  For example user@example.com/work and user@example.com/home would
 * likely be two clients in use by the same user, and so chat messages from 
 * either should go into the same dialogue window.
 *
 * JID objects are immutable, and may be used as keys in collection objects such
 * as dictionaries.
