XMPPKit INSTALL
===============

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use XMPPKit. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

Finally you need from Etoile itself:

   * EtoileXML, which can be found in 
     Etoile/Frameworks/EtoileFoundation/EtoileXML
   * Addresses, which can be found in Etoile/Frameworks/AddressesKit

This last dependency is automatically handled when XMPPKit is built by running
'make' tool in Frameworks or any other parent directories.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make

   * [sudo [-E]] make install
