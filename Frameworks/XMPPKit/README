XMPPKit is an Objective-C implementation of the Extensible Messaging and 
Presence Protocol (XMPP) that can be used to write Jabber-enabled applications.
For more informations about XMPP itself, see <http://xmpp.org/>.

The framework uses EtoileXML for parsing the XML streams of the XMPP protocol.

Etoile also includes a IM client named StepChat built on top of it.
