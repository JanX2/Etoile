	* UKDistributedView.m: got it working (only small fix here,
	  the main problem was that the example didn't set all needed
	  values.)
	* ChangeLog: Added ChangeLog entry from when I fixed the segfault
	  issue when dragging on GS.

	* UKDistributedView.m: prevent crashes by checking if events
	  have deltaX and deltaY fields, which they don't always have
	  on GNUstep.
