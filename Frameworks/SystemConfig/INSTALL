SystemConfig INSTALL
====================

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use SystemConfig. The core packages are, at a minimum:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.


Build and Install
-----------------

Square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate optional parameters.

   Steps to build:

   * make [LIBACPI=yes]

   * [sudo [-E]] make install

If you want to enable power management support based on ACPI, you have to define  
LIBACPI as shown above (minus the square brackets).
