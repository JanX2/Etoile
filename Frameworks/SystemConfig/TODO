SystemConfig TODO
=================


- Finish to support display settings, only partially implemented
- Support for Network settings
- Support for User account configuration
- Support for some Date & Time settings eventually, although a large part can 
  probably be handled in Services/User/Hardware through GNUstep defaults.
- Improve power management related settings. For that, also take a look at 
  System which deals with shut down, sleep etc. by the mean of HAL and D-Bus.
- UI panels for all these settings are work-in-progress and far from finished, 
  take a look at Look & Behavior and Hardware if you are interested in that 
  (both apps are located in Services/User). 
  Most of the work is relatively easy and consists of writing glue code that 
  calls SystemConfig and gives feedback at UI level. Error reporting will 
  surely have to be improved in SystemConfig to give proper feedback to the user.
