SystemConfig is a framework which provides various a common way to set system 
specific preferences by interfacing with the host system. Host system means the 
following combo:

	* operating sytem
	* additional abstraction support (sound, network etc.)
	* display/window server

Versatile and flexible devices support is often done through an extra 
abstraction layer/library on top of the kernel. This is what 'additional 
abstraction support' means. GNOME System tools backend is an example of such
library that allows to set various settings (like network related ones) without
having to pay attention on which operating system Etoile is used.

Build and Install
-----------------

Read INSTALL document.


Mac OS X support
----------------

SystemConfig is a framework specific to Etoile/GNUstep, then it makes no sense 
to use it on a system like Mac OS X without a comprehensive GNUstep install.
There is a similarly named framework on Mac OS X that allows to set some of 
these system preferences.


Known issues
------------ 

     * Most of the implementation code is currently missing.


Developer notes
===============

Tests suite
-----------

UnitKit (bundled with Etoile) is required.

    Steps to produce a test bundle and run tests suite:

    * make test=yes 

    * ukrun SystemConfig.bundle


Dependency
---------

None.
