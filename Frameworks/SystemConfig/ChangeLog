	Necessary changes to compile and link with ACPI support. ACPI is still 
	turned off by default. Made this choice, mostly because libacpi package 
	isn't yet available on Ubuntu (next Ubuntu release Hardy Heron will include 
	it though).
	* GNUmakefile: Modified to link libacpi if ACPI support is enabled.
	* Source/GNUmakefile.preamble: Modified to pass the flag -DLIBACPI if 
	ACPI support is turned on.
	* INSTALL: Updated.
	* README: Listed all authors.

	Applied a patch by Lennart Melzer that implements ACPI support by relying 
	on libacpi. The formatting and the code organization of the patch have been 
	reworked a bit. ACPI support is turned off by default.
	* Source/SCPower_Linux.m 
	(-checkACPIStatus, -ACPIStatus, -APMStatus, -statusFromPercentage): New 
	private methods.
	(-status): Modularized to support both ACPI and APM, mostly done by moving 
	APM code into new method -APMStatus.

	* Source/SCPower_Linux.m: Fixed a compiler warning by replacing 
	multiple return points with a single one and using the unused variable 
	status to store the returned value. Also tidied the formatting a bit.

	Note: Patch submitted by Eric Wasylishen, related to bug #10463 initially 
	reported on etoile-dev.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Fixed header search path to be /usr/include instead
	of /usr/include/sys which contain architecture dependent headers.
	* Source/SCSound.m: Modified to take in account the makefile modification.

	* GNUmakefile:
	* Source/GNUmakefile:
	Fixed linking to link X11 as expected (was broken by library to 
	framework conversion). Normally that should eliminate repository
	compilation error in Hardware which links SystemConfig.
