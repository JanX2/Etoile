2009-08-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Developer/Templates/TestAppTemplate: Added.

2009-04-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Updated for Jaunty Jackalope.

2009-03-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* documentation.make: Added.

2009-03-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh: Applied patch by Devon H. O'Dell, with some minor editing, to 
	support fonts donwload on FreeBSD.

2008-12-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* etoile.make: Rewritten 'prefix' function to simply use the wildcard 
	function from Make rather than 'find -maxdepth 1'; -maxdepth option is not 
	supported on Solaris. Reported by Timothy E. Larson. 

2008-12-02  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* etoile.make: Fixed to use a custom exported LD_LIBRARY_PATH rather than 
	-rpath-link (patch by Truls Becken). This fixes the compilation on platforms 
	where libraries installed in standard locations are not available as static 
	libraries but only as shared libraries. For example, this was reported for 
	libpoppler on Arch Linux by Truls Becken (see 'Build Errors - MediaKit' 
	thread in etoile-dev archive).

2008-10-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Rewritten the build infrastructure of Étoilé to be a lot simpler and more 
	solid.
	This was necessary to eliminate various linking issues, specially when the 
	repository is built from scratch without a prior install. Frameworks 
	linked indirectly (through an intermediate framework) weren't well handled.
	Added the possibility to tweak the modules to build by adding a file named 
	modules.make, see documentation in INSTALL. That will be useful to control 
	what is built in the stable branch without touching the existing 
	GNUmakefiles.
	NOTE: Everything builds and installs fine on my machine, but this 
	represents a major change to the way Etoile was previously compiled, so the 
	repository may not build fine elsewhere.
	* GNUmakefile:
	* Bundles/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Services/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Examples/GNUmakefile:
	* Frameworks/GNUmakefile:
	* Languages/GNUmakefile:
	* Services/GNUmakefile:
	* Services/Private/GNUmakefile:
	* Services/User/GNUmakefile:
	Removed unecessary features of the old build infrastructure, cleansed and 
	rewritten to support turning on and off modules from the build process from 
	a root makefile 'modules.make'. The modules built by default have also 
	changed.
	* Developer/Services/UnitTests/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Examples/LuceneKitExample/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Examples/OgreKitExample/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Examples/DistributedViewExample/GNUmakefile:
	* Developer/Examples/CoreObjectExample/GNUmakefile:
	* Services/User/Melodie/GNUmakefile:
	* Services/Private/ScriptServices/GNUmakefile:
	Included etoile.make.
	* Services/Private/Azalea/GNUmakefile:
	Replaced ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS by Azalea_LDFLAGS, so the render subproject 
	doesn't try to link XWindowServerKit and fails because it doesn't include 
	etoile.make and hence doesn't know about Build dir where XWindowServerKit 
	is available for linking. 
	* etoile.make: Major cleaning and rewrite. Simplified the rules for 
	exporting dependencies and removing them with clean rule. Modified to export 
	all the library files in the Build directory rather than just the 
	non-versionned library file (that ends with .so). It is necessary to ensure 
	linking is well supported: the linker wants to pick the versionned ones for 
	libraries/frameworks that are linked by a target through an intermediate 
	library/framework. To support that, also added -rpath-link to a new exported 
	ADDITIONAL_LDFLAGS variable. Made distclean depends on clean to eliminate 
	the copy/paste of the entire rule code.
	* INSTALL: Updated documentation.

2008-07-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL:
	* INSTALL.Ubuntu:
	* README:
	Updated for Smalltalk dependencies.

2008-08-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL:
	* INSTALL.Ubuntu:
	* README:
	Updated for the upcoming CoreObject dependency on PostgreSQL. Tweaked 
	INSTALL.Ubuntu to specify Cairo instead of libart for Gutsy and added 
	the 'universe' tag to some packages.

2008-06-02  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL: Fixed required GNUstep release versions and mentioned 
	optional -E flag for sudo.

2008-05-16  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Added libssl-dev dependency to all Ubuntu versions.

2008-05-10  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Updated for Hardy Heron.

2008-03-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Included EtoileSerialize in the build process 
	by default now.

2008-02-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Updated for Gutsy Gibbon and expanded the documentation. 
	Fixed Feisty Fawn release number.

2008-02-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* etoile.make: Allowed to override PROJECT_NAME variable per module.

2008-01-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Turned on SystemConfig which got wrongly removed 
	from the build process on r2564.

2007-08-01  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh: Removed spurious -z flag in tar command. Andreas Hoschler
	reported that Solaris don't accept it.

2007-07-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* HACKING: Added a fourth rule about defaults.
	* README: Bumped version number to 0.2. Updated Authors list.

2007-07-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh: Fixed to look for bundles in System domain rather than 
	Local (induced by ETOILE_CORE_MODULE use). Needs improvement.

2007-06-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Services/Private/GNUmakefile: Included Corner, Idle and AZSwitch in the
	build process by default.
	* Services/User/GNUmakefile: Included AddressManager, Grr, Jabber (chat 
	client and Jabber framework) and TermX in build process by default.

2007-06-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh: Implemented automatic Etoile default font installation.

2007-06-13  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Most frameworks and private services will now be installed in System
	domain.
	Warning: check redundant elements in Local and System carefully on next
	install.
	* etoile.make: Added ETOILE_CORE_MODULE support.

2007-06-10  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* README: Added StepTalk and XScreenSaver to Dependency section. 
	Updated gnustep-make required version to 2.0. Removed comment about
	broken 'sudo' support which isn't true anymore (in my experience). 
	Added a clear WARNING to make evident you cannot avoid setup.sh.
	* INSTALL: Made Required software section up-to-date.
	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Updated to take in account new dependencies 
	introduced by Idle. Also explained Edgy Eft section is also valid for
	Feisty Fawn.

2007-05-07  Yen-Ju Chen <yjchen gmail>

	* etoile.make: use $(SHARED_LIBEXT) instead of so. 
	  Patched by Yves de Champlain (#9046).

2007-04-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* README: Updated Dependency section and added David to Authors section
	(now sorted by alphetical order). Also made clearer that Cocoa support 
	isn't our priority.
	* INSTALL: Made Required software section up-to-date.

2007-04-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Turned on IconKit compilation because it is now 
	used by applications like Vindaloo.

2007-04-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* INSTALL.Ubuntu: Updated to take in account latest dependencies introduced
	by System and Azalea. Added a web reference to Ubuntu package list 
	classified by version (Dapper, Breezy etc.).

2007-04-24  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Themes/GNUstep.icontheme: Added GNUstep icon theme by Jesse Ross and 
	Jasper Hauser. This theme follows Freedesktop Icon Naming Specification 
	with some generic extensions and more specific additions (to fit Etoile 
	needs). Ready to be used by IconKit with a minor update of the latter
	framework.

2007-03-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh:
	* setdown.sh:
	Modified to set GWorkspace related defaults as suggested in bug reports
	#8618 and #8668

2007-03-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Services/Private/GNUmakefile: Included AZDock by default in the build 
	process.

2007-03-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* etoile.make: 
	Fixed a typo which prevented real frameworks like PopplerKit to export its 
	headers and library file properly, then any applications which depend on it 
	to compile.
	Added code to have a symbolic libFrameworkName.so pointing on 
	frameworkName.framework/Versions/Current/libFrameworkName.so.
	As a side effect repository build should be fixed (after being broken for a
	while... too bad). 
	Modified $(PROJECT_NAME) references to be always prefixed by 'lib' on 
	library cleaning. It might correct clean or distclean only done partially.
	Also corrected issue #8484 by removing commented out debug statements in 
	the code, therefore the repository should build on SuSE too now.

2007-02-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Frameworks/Services/User: Removed Mollusk reference since it is not part 
	trunk anymore.

2007-02-16  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Modified to include SystemConfig in the build
	process since Hardware now uses it. This should fix the repository 
	build.

2007-02-16  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Bundles/WildMenus: Moved to Deprecated.

2007-02-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Services/User/GNUmakefile: Included Vindaloo by default in Etoile build 
	process.

2007-02-08  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	Warning: 
	1) Run ./setdown.sh on your system before updating or remove all 
	gnustep lib links in /usr/lib, ditto for gnustep  tools in 
	/usr/local/bin
	2) Now the environment should be launched with /usr/local/bin/etoile 
	or ~/etoile and not path/etoile_system anymore.
	* setup.sh: Replaced linking libs into /usr/lib by new script 'etoile' 
	which takes care of sourcing GNUstep.h as an equivalent yet better
	solution. The script is generated on the fly and finally installed in 
	/usr/local/bin or ~/bin.
	* setdown.sh: Symetrical update to match the aforementioned 
	modifications.

2007-02-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* Services/Private/GNUmakefile: Included AZBackground in the build 
	process by default.

2007-02-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

	* setup.sh: Modified to look for AppKit bundles in Local by default 
	(temporary fix).
	* setdown.sh: Removed a line with no purpose.
	* GNUmakefile: Swapped Languages and Frameworks compile order because 
	Io now depends on DistributedView (the last fix to restore repository 
	build).

2007-02-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * INSTALL.Ubuntu: Major update to take in account Edgy Eft and refreshed formatting.

2007-01-11  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Frameworks/ExtendedWorkspaceKit:
    * Frameworks/TrackerKit:
    * GNUmakefile:
    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile: 
    Moved TrackerKit and ExtendedWorkspaceKit frameworks to Deprecated.

2006-12-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * setup.sh:
    * setdown.sh:
    Updated to set NSUseRunningCopy to YES by default.

2006-12-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * HACKING: Updated repository build section with more details.

2006-12-17  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * HACKING: Added.

2006-12-11  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Bundles/GNUmakefile: Updated to include EtoileBehavior in the build 
    process.
    * setup.sh: Modified to set EtoileBehavior as an AppKit bundle with defaults.

2006-12-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * setup.sh:
    * setdown.sh:
    Updated both scripts to link libXWindowServerKit.so and 
    libWorkspaceCommKit.so in /usr/lib. This is rather ugly but necessary
    for my next System update. This commit also includes the draft code based
    on ldconfig (as suggested by Richard Frith-Macdonald). This commented out 
    code should ultimately replace my ugly hack.

2006-12-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * setup.sh:
    * setdown.sh:
    Updated both scripts to support System/SystemTaskList.plist deployment. 
    This is important, otherwise etoile_system won't launch any processes.
    
2006-11-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Added automatic export of common variable values, so they 
    are not repeated over and over in each module.

2006-11-30  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Fixed /bin/sh complaining about a missing argument on line 
    7. This has been corrected by quoting $LIBRARY_NAME and $FRAMEWORK_NAME in
    the elif test which follows. This means an undefined variable results in an
    empty string and not anymore in 'no value at all' (the root of the issue).
    Commented out debug logging.

2006-11-28  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Modified to include better support for library/framework 
    build. Now creates automatically a temporary header directory matching the 
    project name.
    
2006-11-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Deprecated/Workspace: Moved Services/Private/Workspace here to deprecate
    it.

2006-11-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Deprecated: Added a new directory to store deprecated modules in a 
    temporary manner.

2006-11-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * pmkfile: Removed this deprecated file.

2006-11-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Updated to build PaneKit and not PreferencesKit
    anymore. This fixes repository compilation by the way.

2006-10-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Included EtoileFoundation, EtoileUI and 
    DistributedView in Etoile build process by default.

2006-10-19  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * setup.sh:
    * setdown.sh:
    Updated to link libgnustep-gui.so in /usr/lib as a temporary solution since
    etoile_system relies on AppKit currently.
    
2006-10-01  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * GNUmakefile: Modified to build Languages subproject.
    * Languages/GNUmakefile: Added to include Io by default in Etoile build process.

2006-09-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Improved to export library made available in Source/obj too 
    (was only exporting library put in the immediate 'obj' subdirectory).

2006-09-27  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Updated to properly link frameworks in Build directory.
    The framework resulting of a project compilation is located in the project 
    directory itself and not in the 'obj' subdirectory.
    
2006-09-26  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Simplified the dependency handling furthermore by getting
    rid of DEPENDENCIES variable. No need to declare anymore dependencies with
    this variable on per module basis. By including 'etoile.make' the result 
    of the module compilation is automatically exported in common directory 
    named 'Build'. Moreover this directory is searched for libraries, 
    frameworks, headers, bundles etc. when etoile.make is included in a module, 
    this allows to handle related dependencies transparently.

2006-09-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * INSTALL.Ubuntu: New file listing dependencies to install on Ubuntu in
    order to build both GNUstep and Etoile "manually".

2006-09-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Included new PopplerKit and AddressesKit 
    frameworks by default in Etoile build process.

2006-09-13  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * setup.sh: Fixed etoile_system deployment by taking in account that 
    products built by gnustep-make are now always located in 'obj' and not
    anymore in 'shared_obj' too. This is related to latest Nicola Pero
    modifications in gnustep-make (in the days following gnustep-make 1.13 
    release).

2006-09-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Services/User/GNUmakefile: Included Typewriter in Etoile build process by
    default.

2006-09-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * README: Updated url in Contribute section and added new authors.
    * INSTALL: Updated GNUstep libraries requirements to match latest releases,
    this choice avoids the pain to support older versions for now. Added a tip 
    about OniGuruma now available in the repository. Modified Install section
    to discuss new setup.sh script. Added Uninstall section, discussing 
    setdown.sh script too. Added a warning in Custom Build and Install section 
    to outline the important bug that prevents to a build a single module as 
    documented.

2006-08-31  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Services/User/GNUmakefile: Included Grr in Etoile build process by 
    default now.

2006-08-23  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Fixed the library related flag in ADDITIONAL_LIB_DIRS to 
    safely reference shared_obj directory. Updated to include several
    checks that test path related variables are set and won't translate into 
    bad suprises with 'rm'. Removed $(DEPENDENCIES) from target prerequisites
    since this variable isn't a target that results in an error (unless a 
    file with the same name exists); now, we just check the variable is set
    before trying to run dependency related code.

2006-08-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Bundles/GNUmakefile: Updated build process to include WorkspaceSwitcher
    by default. 

2006-08-22  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * etoile.make: Added new makefile to provide various extensions specific to 
    Etoile. When used, it currently enables smoother build process by taking of
    care of including and linking internal dependencies automatically. It's not
    necessary anymore to have a bunch of boilerplate code in each project to
    handle each dependency.

2006-08-21  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * setup.sh: Added more comments about /usr/share/xsessions path variations
    depending on the host system and the display manager.

2006-08-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * setup.sh: Replaced incorrect reference EtoileWildMenus by 
    EtoileMenus.bundle in GSAppKitUserBundles, this allows EtoileWildMenus 
    bundle to be loaded now. Added code to remove repeated slash in 'bundledir'
    path, 'defaults' command was stumbling on it. 
    Improved to take in account when the bundles have been installed in the 
    user Library (well, logically when setup.sh is run without sudo or root 
    permissions).

2006-08-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * setup.sh:
    * setdown.sh:
    Major update to setup related scripts, setup.sh now includes the 
    possibility to choose between a user deployment (without any privileges) 
    and a system deployment (with sudo access or root).
    Futhermore it takes now care to set the necessary defaults for bundles like
    Camaelon and EtoileWildMenus (the update occurs in the defaults of the user
    account which runs the script). By the way, the script handles Nesedah theme
    deployment too.
    setdown.sh has been updated in a symetric way allowing to revert from 
    setup.sh effect.

2006-08-06  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * setup.sh: New postinstall script which links or copies some stuff at the 
    right locations to make Etoile first use a straightforward experience and 
    not a nightmare anymore :-).
    * setdown.sh: New uninstall script to reverse the effect of setup.sh.

2006-06-05  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile: Updated to include XWindowServerKit in the build
    process.

2006-05-11  Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>

    * Themes/Nesedah: Created the Themes directory and imported
    the last version of the Nesedah theme.

2006-02-16  Yen-Ju <yjchenx at gmail>

    * Frameworks/GNUmakefile:
    Do not compile ServicesBarKit on mac. 

2006-02-16  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * ANNOUNCE: Added Etoile 0.1 press release.

2006-01-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * INSTALL:
    * README: 
    Word wrapped the whole text to 80 characters, removed erratic 
    tabs. Added Michael Hanni (WildMenus) in README Authors list.

2006-01-18  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * GNUmakefile: Removed superfluous license notice and PMK mention.

2005-11-29  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * INSTALL: Added (part of the much needed Build Guide).

2005-11-29  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    * README: Added (part of the much needed Build Guide).

2005-11-09  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
    
    Note: pmkfile is deprecated.
    * GNUmakefile: Improved clarity for 'etoile' option.
    * pmkfile: Updated (this file will be removed soon).

2005-06-07  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile not usable (unlike GNUmakefile now).
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to force UnitKit build with 'developer-base=no' 
	when 'make test=yes' is used.

2005-05-21  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile not usable (unlike GNUmakefile now).
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to take in account developer examples.

2005-03-20  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile not usable (unlike GNUmakefile now).
	* GNUmakefile: Updated to take in account user services.

2005-03-12  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile not usable (unlike GNUmakefile now).
	* GNUmakefile: Added with the whole build support.

2005-03-10  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile and GNUmakefile not usable.
	* pmkfile: Improved and updated to match new pmk versions.

2005-01-04  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>
	
	Warning! pmkfile not usable.
	* pmkfile: Added a pmkfile (pmk 0.8.2 needed) in order to check installation 
	environment and control Etoile build options. To know more about pmk and 
	install it : http://pmk.sourceforge.net/
