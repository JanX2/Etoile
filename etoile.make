### Internal dependency handling ###

#
# To declare one or several dependencies, use the variable DEPENDENCIES. For
# example 
# DEPENDENCIES = PreferencesKit UnitKit 
# means your project depends on PreferencesKit and UnitKit, by the way needs to
# include and link them. 
# Take note etoile.make won't alter the build order of modules, then you have 
# to specify it properly in the root GNUmakefile in order to have your project 
# building after PreferencesKit and UnitKit.
#

EtoileExtensionsKit = Frameworks/EtoileExtensionsKit
LuceneKit = Frameworks/LuceneKit
OgreKit = Frameworks/OgreKit
PreferencesKit = Frameworks/PreferencesKit
RSSKit =  = Frameworks/RSSKit
UnitKit =  = Frameworks/UnitKit
XWindowServerKit = Frameworks/XWindowServerKit

# FIXME: For now we support only one dependency specified through DEPENDENCIES,
# that's why we extract the only dependency stored in it and put it into 
# DEPENDENCY variable currently used our code.

DEPENDENCY = $(DEPENDENCIES)

# We treat the value of the variable DEPENDENCY as a variable. Here is an 
# example of what happens:
# PreferencesKit =  Frameworks/PreferencesKit
# DEPENDENCY = PreferencesKit
# DEPENDENCY_PATH = Frameworks/PreferencesKit
# because $($(DEPENDENCY)) == $(PreferencesKit) == Frameworks/PreferencesKit

DEPENDENCY_PATH = $($(DEPENDENCY))

# CURDIR is the path where make is run, with gnustep-make the value changes in
# subdirectories since each 'submake' is a 'normal' make, sandboxed and not 
# run recursively from the initial directory.
#
# PROJECT_DIR is the path where make is invoked, the first directory where 
# make is run, this variable allows to keep a reference to the initial 
# directory taking in account the previous comment about CURDIR.
#
# PWD or ./ is the path where the current makefile is located (for 
# etoile.make, this is always Etoile/)

# Finally we search etoile.make path in the repository... because Make doesn't 
# provide any variables to obtain included makefile paths (well, I would like
