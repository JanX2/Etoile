Etoile INSTALL
==============

Required software
-----------------

You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to
compile and use Etoile. The core packages are, at a minimum:

    * gnustep-make 1.11 or higher

    * gnustep-base 1.11 or higher

    * gnustep-gui 0.10 or higher

    * gnustep-back 0.10 or higher

See <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.
   
   
You need some extra libraries if you intend to build a complete Etoile
environment or the whole repository:
    
    * libpng (IconKit)

    * zlib (LuceneKit)
    
    See <http://www.zlib.net/> for further information.
    
    * OniGuruma 3.8.6 or higher (OgreKit)
    
    See <http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/> for further information. 
    
    * sqlite3 (SQLiteClient)
    
    See <http://www.sqlite3.org> for further information. 
    
    * SQLClient (SQLiteClient)

Notation
--------

    In the following text, square brackets "[ ]" are used to indicate an
    optional parameter, while "*" at the beginning of a line indicate a 
    command.


Build and Install
-----------------

Steps to build:

    * make
    * sudo make install
    

Custom Build and Install
------------------------

In order to build and install the whole project (with the exception of
developers tools like UnitKit), you can just type in the root directory (named
Etoile):

    * make
    * [sudo] make install

Which is the equivalent for the build system of asking to build the etoile
module:

    * make etoile=yes
    * [sudo] make etoile=yes install

Indeed, you can choose to build only a specific module. Simply follow 'make'
with the module's name (in lowercase) set to yes. For example:

    * make camaelon=yes
    * make camaelon=yes install

Will only build and install Camaelon.

You can combine more than one module:

    * make camaelon=yes lucenekit=yes

And even use custom set of modules, like desktop-base. Here is a list of the
current sets of modules:

    * desktop-base --> camaelon, bookmarkkit, iconkit, preferenceskit
    * user-base --> installer (for now that's all)
    * developer-base --> unitkit, unittests, examples
    * etoile-extensions --> lucenekit, extendedworkspacekit, trackerkit,
    servicesbarkit, servicesbar

The 'etoile' option semantic is a bit special:

    * etoile=yes --> desktop-base, user-base, etoile-extensions, workspace
    * etoile=no --> desktop-base, developer-base // everything which is not
    bound to Etoile itself

Finally you can combine these module sets with specific module options, like:

    * make developer-base=yes camaelon=yes // build developer-base and camaelon
    * make desktop-base=no camaelon=yes // build user-base, etoile-extensions,
    workspace and camaelon (but not other desktop-base stuff)
    * make etoile=no etoile-extensions=yes extendedworkspacekit=no


You can use the 'make' command with all the available options from every
projects directory.

You can also build test bundles for any specified modules by adding an option
'test=yes', in future you should be able to run every test bundles with 'make
check' but this not implemented currently.
